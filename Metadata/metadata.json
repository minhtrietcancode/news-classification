The May rally could be in trouble as a new month of trading approaches. The two unfilled up gaps in the S & P 500 SPDR ETF from earlier this spring are \"an issue\" for the market and will more than likely have to be \"answered.\" A sell-off down to the May 9 unfilled gap (at the 567.50 level) and a filling of said gap would represent a 3.05% decline for the market (from current levels). A drop to the April 23 unfilled gap (at the 529.30 level) and a filling of said gap would represent a 9.56% plunge for the market (from current levels). By our work, both unfilled gaps are \"in play\" this summer. DISCLOSURES: None.

Josh — Earnings season is super annoying for trend-following investment strategies. The potential for both positive and negative surprises is higher, which can lead to reversals in trend and gappy trading before and after the opening and closing bells of trading. It can be a minefield. Sean and I try to avoid highlighting names right before they report for this reason. This time, however, we're going to break that tradition and show you a few set-ups for companies due to report this week. There are seven companies on our Best Stocks in the Market list reporting this week. One of them - Fastenal (FAST) - will have already released results prior to this column coming out. Three others have charts that appear to be losing momentum and threatening a downside breach of their uptrends - Kinder Morgan (KMI) , Abbott Labs (ABT) and Cintas (CTAS) — so we'll skip over those. The other three are worth taking a look at. BlackRock (BLK) , Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Netflix (NFLX) are all strong stocks at interesting inflection points. Let's do some high-level stats on the overall list and then we'll dive in. Sector Leaderboard As of 7/14/2025, there are 136 names on The Best Stocks in the Market list Top Sector Ranking: Top Industries: Top 5 Best Stocks by Relative Strength: Sector Spotlight: Sean — Coming into earnings, all 3 major indices are within 2% of all-time highs: While prices are at or near all-time highs, earnings estimates are not. Throughout Q2, EPS estimates for the S & P 500 have declined 4.2% for this upcoming earnings season. In most quarters, analysts are usually adjusting their estimates down, so this is nothing unusual. However, over the past 20 quarters, the average decline in EPS estimates during the quarter has been a decline of 3%. The average of the past 60 quarters (15 years) has been a decline of 3.2%. So, estimates have shifted further down than normal. On a sectoral basis, every sector saw EPS adjustments lowered, except for communications, which stayed flat. Energy, discretionary, and materials were the three worst sectors with the highest decline in estimates at -18.9%, -7.4%, and -6.4% respectively (from start of quarter to end of quarter). (Data via Factset) Either analysts are lowering the bar for what could be a better-than-expected earnings season, or analysts were too bullish on U.S. earnings power amidst a myriad of risks. This goes without saying, but earnings can be a tumultuous period for single stockholders. It's fair to assume most of a stock's earnings outcome is priced in, but more often than not, the market will have some type of response to earnings. In recent quarters, companies have beaten earnings but issued softer forward guidance; a lot of times, that bit of news is not priced in. Earnings can greatly affect the behavior of investors, and thus earnings can affect the technicals of a stock, which matter to us, a lot. We want to show a couple set-ups of stocks that report earnings this week, so that investors are prepared for a range of possible outcomes coming into these events. BlackRock (BLK) - reports on Tuesday: Sean — Wall Street expects revenue of $5.47 billion, up 13.8% year-over-year and EPS of $10.80, up 4.3% year-over-year. (data via S & P Global and Quartr) Josh — BlackRock exploded higher this summer as the flows into ETFs followed (propelled, some might say) the stock market up and to the right. BlackRock is one of the most pro-cyclical stocks in the market. When asset values are booming and investors want in, their asset gathering activity picks up and, with it, the investment management fees. BlackRock's \"all in\" initiatives around crypto and private equity products are a big part of the story. In the short term, this is an extended name, far above its 200-day. The recent record high and golden cross (50-day moving above the 200-day) make me want to give it the benefit of the doubt. If you're not already in the stock, I'd wait for the report to come out and focus on a buying opportunity into any profit-taking. So long as it holds above $1,000, I think you can be long. Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) - reports Thursday Sean — Wall Street expects revenue of $1.38 billion, up 11.8% year-over-year and EPS of $0.46, up 5.2% year-over-year. (data via S & P Global and Quartr) Josh — IBKR is emerging out of a cup-and-handle pattern which you can clearly see in the chart above. RSI at 71 could be considered \"overbought\" but I don't look at it that way. I see it as a sign of strength when it's accompanying new record high levels in price. Considering the outrageous rally in competitor Robinhood (HOOD) — up 112% since April 30th — this momentum in IBKR makes sense. HOOD is a good comp because, according to Morningstar, approximately 55% of IBKR's commission revenue is retail trading vs 45% institutional. One of the most important metrics IBKR is judged on each quarter is account growth — how many new brokerage clients are they adding to the platform. In Q4, Interactive added 217,000 new accounts, pushing the full year total to above 775,000. Then in Q1 they put up an even more explosive number, 279,000 new accounts, up 32% over the same quarter a year before. There's a seasonality to account opening activity, so expect the pace to decelerate when they report this week. But if the results are solid, there's no reason why this name can't break away and forge a new trading range above current resistance at $60. Netflix (NFLX) - reports on Thursday Sean — Wall Street expects revenue of $11.0 billion, up 15.5% year-over-year and EPS of $7.08, up 45.2% year-over-year. (data via S & P Global and Quartr) Josh — We've been writing positively about Netflix all spring and summer given the powerful rally and accompanying upside fundamental surprises along the way. Netflix continues to shock The Street. That said, recent price action says the stock may have gotten ahead of itself in the short-term. NFLX is in a 7% drawdown from its high, hopefully finding support at the 50-day moving average. I own the stock from lower levels and plan to remain long. If I had no position, I would wait and see rather than buy in anticipation of the earnings print. A \"sell the news\" reaction post-earnings might open up a better entry point. We'll follow up on this.

Here's how the pros are investingPublished Mon, Jul 14 202510:32 PM EDTUpdated 4 Hours AgoAmala Balakrishner@in/amala-balakrishner@_amalabkWATCH LIVEU.S. President Donald Trump's fresh 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico have sent gold prices higher. The previous metal topped a three-week high on Monday , as investors piled into gold, which is usually considered a safe haven asset in times of turbulence. As of 10:20 p.m. ET Monday, spot gold was up 0.21% at $3,350.69 per ounce. Mounting geopolitical tensions and uncertainties from Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs have sent gold prices up by around 28% since the start of the year. By comparison, the broad-based S & P 500 index has risen 6.58% in the same time, while yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury have moved down 13.4 basis points. \"Gold has outperformed the S & P 500 and even other traditional safe haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries, which haven't necessarily provided that stability because of their volatility and fluctuating yields,\" Alonso Munoz, chief investment officer and founding partner at the U.S.-headquartered Hamilton Capital Partners, said. XAU= YTD mountain Mounting geopolitical tensions and uncertainties from Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs have sent gold prices up by around 28% since the start of the year Speaking to CNBC Pro, Munoz noted a pick-up in investor interest in the precious metal \"after they've seen gold outperform and act as a hedge, at least certainly during the first and second quarter, where we had a lot of volatility in high-risk assets.\" The investor sees scope for gold to continue to push higher this year, \"as long as things remain uncertain.\" Chee Keong Koh, head of forex strategy at wealth management firm WRISE, said he expects spot gold to hover between $3,100 and $3,500 for the rest of 2025. \"Gold's performance during times of crises, its ability to act as a store of value and its role as an effective diversifier continue to be key reasons for why investors continue to allocate gold as part of risk management and tactical trading strategies, as global reserves increasingly shift away from heavy U.S. dollar reliance over the next five years ,\" Koh said, citing findings from a recent survey by the World Gold Council. The council — which represents the gold industry — found that 95% of survey respondents foresee an increase in global central banks' gold reserves in the next 12 months. Meanwhile, 73% predict significantly lower U.S. dollar holdings within reserves over the next five years. Aside from the de-dollarization push, Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist APAC at LGT Private Banking Asia, expects gold prices to rise further as the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to lower interest rates . He foresees gold hitting $3,650 per ounce in the next 12 months, a close to 9% rise from its current levels. \"Inflation expectations are going up. People are going to be buying gold against that,\" Hofer told CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Monday. Hofer dismissed \" outlandish \" calls of gold reaching $5,000 per ounce or more, but said a 10% rise over the next 12 months, \"means, that in a portfolio context, you could do rather well if you have maybe, say, 5% or so allocation.\" Gold stocks and ETFs WRISE's Koh recommends that investors who want to buy into gold consider entering closer to the $3,100-per-ounce range \"as part of a broader portfolio diversification strategy.\" Among his top gold stock picks are mining companies Barrick Gold and Newmont Corporation . Both companies present \"solid opportunities given their solid earnings growth and strategic positioning in the gold market,\" according to Koh. Beyond stocks, he also sees opportunities in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF and VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF . The former has returned nearly 55% since the start of the year, while the latter's returns are over 60%. Physical gold Holding on to physical gold, in the form of gold bars, is another way to invest, Hamilton Capital's Munoz pointed out. \"I've always thought that if investors own gold, for its safety and protection against catastrophe and significant drops in the market, they should own it physically versus just tracking the price of gold in a product where there's counterparty risk,\" he said. The investor observes that his clients, who are predominantly high-net-worth individuals and family offices, like that physical gold is a \"safe and tangible store of value that tracks the price of gold at a much lower cost.\" For instance, an ETF charges investors between 10-40 basis points each year just to own a derivative of gold. So an investor with a 5% allocation to gold by way of an ETF will make a cost saving by owning the physical metal, Munoz said. However, those considering buying physical gold should consider storage costs , he added. Safe haven? While gold is often touted as the classic safe-haven asset, Will McDonough, CEO of merchant bank Corestone Capital, believes it could be losing its edge. He said rival asset classes could include copper, as well as bitcoin, which crossed the $120,000 threshold to hit a record high on Monday . \"Gold has far less real-world use cases than copper. And bitcoin is taking a lot of energy away from gold — so the safe-haven allocation that used to go to gold is now facing competition from other assets,\" McDonough told CNBC Pro. Still, the investor sees value in gold by way of the physical asset and gold futures.More In Investing trendsComing to a 401(k) near you: Private market assetsSarah MinTrump’s copper tariff supercharges U.S. prices — but experts are divided if there is an investment opportunityAmala BalakrishnerSingapore state investor Temasek is rethinking defense as a strategic ESG betChloe TaylorRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

In a note dated Thursday, the firm upgraded the chip stock to buy from hold and hiked its price target to $245 from $200, which implies more than 11% upside. \"With more confidence the industrial semis de-stocking is ending, and flexible CapEx in 2026+, we raise our estimates and upgrade shares of TI to Buy with a $245 PT,\" analyst Joshua Buchalter wrote. \"Tariff/ macro concerns linger, but we see TI positioned to outperform in either a sharp or gradual recovery.\" Texas Instruments has surged nearly 49% over the past three months, outpacing both the S & P 500 and artificial intelligence chip darling Nvidia during that timeframe. Shares have also more than doubled the broader market's gains in 2025, rising more than 17% year to date compared to the S & P 500's almost 7% jump. TXN NVDA 3M mountain TXN vs. NVDA, 3-month Though Buchalter noted that President Donald Trump's tariffs linger , which could lead to some demand constraints, he thinks \"inventory dynamics are the bigger swing factor for broad-based semis this earnings season.\" \"Given TI's limited use of the channel, we believe the company is at the front of the line to participate in a recovery as consumption more closely matches sell-through, and for any potential end demand recovery,\" he wrote. \"As supply and demand more closely align, we believe TI's cost-accretive US-based 300mm manufacturing footprint, and realigned embedded portfolio, position the company to regain share in key industrial and automotive end markets.\" Beyond that, Buchalter said the company will generate significant free-cash-flow growth, seeing it more than double in share price by 2026. He also estimates that its capital expenditures will reach $2.5 billion next year. Buchalter's bullish call is in the minority on Wall Street, however. Out of the 39 analysts covering Texas Instruments, only 12 have a strong buy or buy rating, according to LSEG, while 23 have stepped to the sidelines with a hold rating. The stock was almost 1% higher in the premarket on Friday following the upgrade.More In Analyst CallsThis Chinese robotaxi stock can more than double as production ramps up, analysts say Brian EvansHere are Monday's biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Rivian, Best Buy, Taiwan Semiconductor, Coinbase and moreMichael BloomEvercore ISI downgrades Procter & Gamble as it loses market share on AmazonLisa Kailai HanRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Investors have been largely pushing past the threat of ongoing tariffs placed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite each hit a fresh high on Thursday, illustrating how far the market has come since its significant losses in early April. Still, the S & P 500 ended the week at a loss, a sign of how sentiment remains uneasy amid unpredictable trade policy. As the second half gets underway, the firm's co-head of Americas equities research Pedro Martins Junior surveyed JPMorgan's top-ranked U.S. equity research analysts to find their \"most compelling structural and tactical short ideas\" for the rest of 2025. These short ideas identify companies that JPMorgan analysts believe will see a decline in share price, giving investors an opportunity to profit from those downturns. The firm gave stock ideas across a variety of sectors, including consumer, health care, technology and energy. Take a look at eight of the short picks below: Tesla, rated underweight by JPMorgan analysts, is one of the firm's top short ideas. Analyst Ryan Brinkman said the electric vehicle company has a \"sky-high valuation\" compared with the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech names, despite his forecast for Tesla's earnings per share to decline for a third consecutive year in 2025. \"Reduced EV subsidies threaten already marginal profitability (EBIT margin below GM & Ford). Robo-taxi effort likely to disappoint, given lack of sensor redundancy,\" Brinkman said about Tesla. Tesla shares are down nearly 22% year to date. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an X post earlier this week that the company is expanding its robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, and is bringing xAI's controversial AI chatbot Grok to Tesla vehicles. Washing machines and refrigerator manufacturer Whirlpool is another stock JPMorgan views as a strong short pick, primarily due to its high valuation. \"We expect WHR to underperform its peers this earnings season, as we point to the stock's strong performance since June 1, up 38%, versus our universe's average 14% gain (ex- WHR; S & P up 6%), as well as its expensive valuation compared to history, trading at EV/EBITDA multiples more than 15% above its 5 and 10-year averages,\" analyst Michael Rehaut wrote to clients. Shares are down more than 5% year to date. Rehaut is keeping a neutral rating on Whirlpool given the company's potential to benefit from U.S. tariff policies. Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer said last month that U.S. duties could add between $50 and $70 to the retail price of appliances made by competing companies, giving Whirlpool a potential edge. The company has touted itself as \"a net winner of new tariff policies\" since 80% of its products are made domestically. WHR 1Y mountain Whirlpool stock performance. Other stocks JPMorgan says to short are Moderna , Mobileye Global and Shake Shack . The firm is notably bearish on Moderna, which is down 19% for the year even after seeing shares make a more than 20% recovery over the past month. \"We do not see a near-term catalyst that is likely to drive MRNA stock significantly higher,\" analyst Jessica Fye said. \"The combination of ongoing cash burn, coupled with regulatory headwinds and legal issues, make MRNA a tough story to be constructive on near-term.\" Wall Street analysts covering Moderna have a consensus price target that forecasts about 40% upside. But out of the 26 analysts, 18 have a hold rating on shares while three have an underperform rating.More In Analyst CallsThis Chinese robotaxi stock can more than double as production ramps up, analysts say Brian EvansHere are Monday's biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Rivian, Best Buy, Taiwan Semiconductor, Coinbase and moreMichael BloomEvercore ISI downgrades Procter & Gamble as it loses market share on AmazonLisa Kailai HanRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

The muni market, in general, has been the worst-performing fixed-income asset class so far this year through the second quarter, said Dan Close, head of municipals at Nuveen. That has created a unique opportunity to nab the bonds at bargain prices — with yields that are approaching 10-year highs, he said. Yields move inversely to prices, so the market's recent weakness equates to higher yields. For instance, an AA-rated water revenue bond from New York City Water Finance Authority that has a 4.75% tax free yield equals a taxable equivalent yield of about 10.6% for residents in the highest tax bracket, Close said. Water revenue bonds are primarily AA-rated obligations, he noted. They generally finance projects related to water infrastructure like water treatment plants and pipelines. \"You're approaching equity-like returns for what some would argue is the safest sector in municipals,\" Close said in an interview with CNBC. \"This sector, historically, has had one of the lowest default instances in the municipal space.\" As essential service monopoly bonds, they are minimally affected by tariffs and economic slowdowns, he added. \"If these essential service monopolies that are super low defaults are going in and producing these outsized yields, now might be an opportunity to take a look at water and sewer and, by extension, the entire municipal asset class,\" he said. FLAAX YTD mountain Nuveen All-American Municipal Bond Fund in 2025. Nuveen's All American Municipal Bond Fund holds water revenue munis, including those issued by the Great Lakes Water Authority. A-shares of the fund have a 30-day SEC yield of 4.07% and a 0.76% gross expense ratio. The Nuveen Intermediate Duration Municipal Bond Fund also holds water revenue bonds from issuers such as Honolulu City and County. The fund's A-shares have a 3.11% 30-day SEC yield and a 0.65% gross expense ratio. $1.2 trillion investment needed The country's deteriorating infrastructure and the remediation of \" forever chemicals\" such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl , or PFAS, from drinking water are going to drive bond issuance in the sector, Close said. \"Aging systems can pose serious public safety risks, from frequent water main breaks to lead contamination and waterborne disease,\" he wrote in a recent note . Some $1.2 trillion in investments over the next 20 years are needed to address these infrastructure concerns, according to reports from the Environmental Protection Agency . On top of that, remediation of PFAS from drinking water needs to be funded, Close told CNBC. PFAS comes from products like nonstick cookware or certain food packaging and don't easily break down in the environment or, if ingested, in bodies. \"It's going to impact 15% of utilities in the United States,\" he said. \"This alone to remediate this new risk is going to cost between $40 and $90 billion.\" The EPA finalized rules last year requiring utilities to reduce exposure to PFAS in drinking water. But last month the agency said it will weaken limits on some of the chemicals. Shorter term, a less-aggressive EPA may make the metrics look better for utilities as future capital plans get pushed out, Close noted. \"[However], you have to continue to invest in your infrastructure in order to be able to meet the growing needs of delivering water and sewer [services] to the average household,\" he said. Meanwhile, water scarcity is a challenge in the West and Southwest, Close said. That means investments in projects to recycle, desalinate and conserve water, he noted. For instance, the Southern California Metropolitan Water District has been facing supply constraints thanks to ongoing droughts, he pointed out. It plans to build a multi-billion dollar water recycling plant , along with its partner the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. It has already accumulated $1.6 billion in funds and plans to finance the remaining amount with grants, internal funds and municipal bond issuance, Close said. Finding opportunities When choosing water revenue bonds, Close considers a number of factors, including issuer's financial liquidity, which he measures by the cash it has on hand. He also looks at how much debt the issuer has, as well the affordability of its services — the water rates versus the demographic profile of the population. In addition, he looks at projected capital plans. For instance, whether the issuer is subject to future PFAS remediation. \"If you are, you might have to go in and take on enough debt that you might have some stress on your current credit ratings,\" he said. However, for an investor who does his homework, the rewards are there, he said.More In Income InvestingDividend payouts could hit a record this year.

Financial experts weigh in on the best ways to recover from a period of overspending. \"Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn't represent the pace of your entire life,\" says financial advisor Lazetta Rainey Braxton.Jose Luis Pelaez Inc | DigitalVision | Getty ImagesIt's officially \"Maycember,\" a term making the rounds on social media to sum up the chaos and high costs of May — which mimic those of December, minus the holiday cheer.Although May is typically a month of endings and new beginnings, inflation and social pressure have helped drive up the prices for many of the expenses that fall within its 31 days.From graduation gifts and prom attire to camp payments, dance recitals and sports tournaments, the gauntlet of events has left parents feeling particularly strained.Why 'Maycember' is 'a storm of financial stress'\"May often feels like a second December because so many expenses pile up at once,\" said Isabel Barrow, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"Graduations, school events, weddings and summer travel plans all converge, creating a storm of financial stress.\"More from FA Playbook:Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.3 key money moves to consider while the Fed keeps interest rates higherThe average 401(k) savings rate hit a record high. See if you're on trackAmericans believe real estate, gold are the best long-term investmentsThe key is not to panic, Barrow said. \"It's important to remember that a long-term plan requires long-term perspective, and one month of overspending doesn't have to derail your financial goals.\"How to bounce back in JuneMost financial experts recommend going back to a basic budget. \"The first step towards recovery is to take the time to review your spending and reassess your financial plan,\" Barrow said. \"Financial well-being begins with awareness and the feeling that you are regaining control.\"If you've racked up credit card debt, start addressing that immediately, Barrow said. To stay motivated, try picking a repayment strategy, such as the avalanche method or the snowball method, which respectively prioritize paying off the highest-interest debt first or paying off your debt from smallest to largest balance.At the same time, automating your savings is one of the best ways to rebuild after a heavy spending period, Barrow said: \"Set up a recurring transfer to your emergency fund or savings account.\" If your employer offers direct deposit splitting, use that to route a portion of your paycheck directly into savings, she advised.watch nowVIDEO2:3702:37Parents want schools to step up in teaching kids financial literacyPower LunchThe start of summer is also a good time to scale back, according to certified financial planner Lazetta Rainey Braxton, founder and managing principal of the Real Wealth Coterie. Pack a picnic lunch for a day at the park, or \"find free events such as museum days and public events.\"There may also be more opportunities to pick up a side gig this time of year, she added, such as babysitting or tutoring over the long break from school. Those funds can help turbocharge debt repayment. Plan ahead for next 'Maycember'\"Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn't represent the pace of your entire life,\" said Braxton, who is a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. \"Use your experience as a guide with a rearview mirror.\"Tally what you've spent on activities and celebrations such as Mother's Day, graduations and vacations, as well as any payments towards camps or summer activities. Use that total to make a plan for next year, she advised.\"Start a Maycember fund by creating a separate savings account and setting aside $25 a month or more,\" she said. That advance planning can also come in handy to make the most of sales holidays later in the year, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, she added.Still, \"It's important to remember that you don't need to overspend or go beyond your budget to give meaningful gifts,\" cautioned Kelli Smith, a director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"Thoughtfulness and creativity can make a big impact.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.More In FA PlaybookMost Americans say this financial milestone makes you an adultJessica DicklerAverage 401(k) savings rates are at record-high levels.

Image Provided by Richard and Jill WendtAfter years of feeling unwell and overweight, Richard and Jill Wendt decided to embark on a weight loss journey together.The couple lost a combined 118 pounds by following the Mayo Clinic Diet.Today, they both feel physically and mentally healthier.In 2023, Jill and Richard Wendt decided to take charge of their weight and health. 51-year-old Richard had been taking blood pressure medication since his late 20s and used a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. And 49-year-old Jill reached a weight that made her feel uncomfortable and self-conscious.“Over the course of time, the weight just kept going up and up. It just kind of happens without you realizing it,” Jill told Healthline. “You just feel down and out about yourself, and you get in the cycle of, well, that sucks. I can’t find pants that fit, might as well go home and have something to eat because what’s the point? I can’t find clothes anyway?”Realizing that work stress and unhealthy eating habits had taken a toll on their health, the couple wanted to make a change.“[Knowing] what challenges our parents and grandparents had, if we can do anything to be proactive going into our older years, we wanted to be able to do that,” said Jill. “We might not be able to avoid some of those illnesses, but maybe they won’t be as bad for us.”They researched weight loss programs and decided to try the Mayo Clinic Diet in June 2023.Since then, Jill has lost 60 pounds, and Richard has lost 58 pounds. He no longer takes blood pressure medication or uses a CPAP machine.“I’m a stress eater, so [the diet] kind of brought that to my attention,” said Richard. “When I was in the office, it was easy having a stressful day to get up and walk to the snack machine and grab a bag of M&Ms or [when I’m] working from home, walk up the stairs and grab a bowl of cereal.”In addition to offering a food plan, he said the Mayo Clinic Diet helped him understand his unhealthy habits and how to practice healthier habits.What the Mayo Clinic Diet offersThe Mayo Clinic Diet is a digital weight loss program that uses a food groups system to create a whole-health menu program to follow.“It’s the perfect fit for all the patients who’ve walked into my office and said, ‘Can you please just tell me what to eat?’” Tara Schmidt, lead dietitian for the Mayo Clinic Diet, told Healthline.People can choose from seven different meal plans, including Simple, Healthy Keto, Mediterranean, and Protein Balance for GLP-1s.“We have numerous Diet members who are actively taking anti-obesity medications. With this in mind, we created a specific meal plan to address the unique needs of those on these medications, group coaching sessions around frequently asked questions, and continue to update content the more we learn from individuals and research,” said Schmidt.The program also provides education and behavior change and offers tools like recipes, virtual support, peer support, and a food tracker.The Wendts chose the Simple plan, which offers quick recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.“We did some freelancing with it and changed things or ingredients a little bit ourselves but generally tried to follow that,” said Richard. “It never felt like you were dieting, which is one of the things we really enjoyed about it. You were eating healthy, and nothing is off limits.”One stipulation for finding a program was not feeling deprived of foods they enjoy. For instance, following a program that removed dairy was out of the question.“[We] both grew up on a farm, and I love my milk. I’m not giving that up, so maybe I don’t drink as much, or if you like your sweets, you can still have them, but maybe you just don’t do it every night…or you find something that substitutes for that sweetness,” said Jill.Going back to the basics of healthy eating is something that Jill also gained from the program.“It’s re-learning what you learned as a kid with the food pyramid, the right portion sizes, it’s okay not to eat everything on your plate if you take too much, or if you’re at a restaurant, it’s okay to take the leftovers home,” she said.Christina Brown, MS, ACSM CPT, a nutrition and weight loss coach, said the majority of weight loss results are due to changing eating habits to ensure that people are not only eating quality calories but also eating in a calorie deficit.“In order to lose weight, you must eat fewer calories than you are burning,” she told Healthline. “The easiest way to ensure you are doing this is to track everything you are eating so you know exactly how many calories you take in. You cannot out-exercise a bad diet.”Breaking old habits and making healthier onesGuidance on habits to add and habits to break is another aspect of the diet that resonated with the couple.For instance, the habits they added included eating a healthy breakfast, as well as eating more vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and healthy fats.Some habits they learned to break included watching TV while eating, snacking (except for vegetables and fruit), and consuming sugar and alcohol.“I review the healthy habits every day before I go to sleep,” said Richard. “[Maybe] I didn’t have whole grains today…you’re not going to meet everything every day but just to keep that general trend of making sure you’re not straying off those healthy habits.”The couple incorporated the habit of exercising into their program, too, with Jill walking daily and Richard turning walking into running.“I was never much of a morning person, but now…I try to be out running by 5:30 most mornings. It just became something…I found out I really enjoyed,” he said.Losing weight together makes it easierResearch shows that people with partners who participate in lifestyle programs are more successful in reducing weight.“Unfortunately, we can very easily give up on ourselves, but if we have someone else counting on us, we are much less likely to give up,” said Brown.For example, she said if your partner is sticking to healthy meal planning, you will be more likely to or if you know they are meeting you at the gym for a workout, you will go even if you don’t want to because it is harder to cancel on them than on yourself.This notion motivated the Wendts to try the Mayo Clinic Diet together. If Jill signed up, she told Richard he also needed to.“I’m the one that usually prepares the meals, so to do it just for myself and then have to try to make something separate for him…would be difficult, but if we’re in it together, it’s easier,” she said.In addition to eating the same food, following habits together, like not eating in front of the TV, also helped them stick to it.Although the couple hit their goals, they plan to stay on the program for a while to maintain their weight and continue to use the program’s resources like its tracker and recipes.Schmidt said the program is a lifelong health approach and not a program that preaches a certain number of weeks of toughness.“We’re teaching our members to build new habits and slowly create eating and exercise practices they can continue long term,” she said. “A key predictor of weight loss maintenance is adherence. It’s important for people to find a method they can see themselves practicing for life.”The benefits the Wendts have experienced are their biggest motivator to carry on healthy habits after they stop the program.“We were putting up Christmas decorations yesterday and we were like wow a year or two years ago, going through the effort of hauling everything out we would be sweating and winded but this time…it wasn’t a struggle to get the boxes out,” said Jill.Feeling well together is the most rewarding part of their journey, she added.“Doing it together has been a fun thing to do…it just brings you closer cause you’re in it together,” said Jill.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Cathy Cassata on January 6, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextCan TikTok’s Viral 12-3-30 Treadmill Workout Really Help You Lose Weight?

What Experts ThinkWritten by Nancy Schimelpfening, MS on May 28, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJShare on PinterestFibermaxxing emphasizes fiber intake during meals and snacks, which could aid weight loss and help lower the risk of chronic diseases. Knape/Getty Images‘Fibermaxxing’ is TikTok’s latest nutrition trend emphasizing fiber intake during meals and snacks.Nutrition experts say fibermaxxing can provide numerous health benefits, including weight loss and a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases.Older adults and those with certain health conditions should consult with their doctor before increasing fiber intake.If you don’t normally eat a lot of fiber, build up slowly to avoid gastrointestinal upset.TikTokers are bulking up — not at the gym, but in the produce aisle.The latest viral nutrition trend is “fibermaxxing,” which has influencers cramming their shopping carts with fiber-rich veggies, beans, and whole grains.Advocates say fibermaxxing offers more than just digestive perks. By nourishing gut bacteria and supporting hormone balance, maximizing your fiber intake could help regulate mood and promote weight loss.The trend is also linked to improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels, which could lower the risk of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), heart disease, and even some cancers, including colorectal cancer.But is more always better when it comes to fibrous roughage?Healthline spoke with dietitians to learn more about the benefits and potential pitfalls of fibermaxxing.What is fibermaxxing?Kara Landau, RD, of the Gut Feeling Consultancy and nutrition advisor to the Global Prebiotic Association, explained that fibermaxxing focuses on consciously adding more fiber to your meals and snacks throughout the day to ensure that you are getting enough.“Compared to many of the unsafe and not scientifically supported dietary trends that sweep across social media, fibermaxxing at its essence is actually a very positive direction for people’s eating patterns to go,” she told Healthline, “and is aligned with common dietary advice offered by many registered dietitians and health care professionals.”Landau noted that dietary fiber recommendations generally vary by age and sex.However, the range is generally from 25 to 38 grams per day, with the lower end for females and the higher end for males.These numbers go down slightly for adults over 50, she added.Dahlia Marin, RDN, LD, CGN, CEO at Married to Health, further clarified the fiber needs of older adults. She said adult males over 50 only need 30 grams per day, while adult females in this age group only need 21 grams per day.Children require anywhere from 14 to 25 grams of daily fiber, depending on age and sex, she said.Fiber may promote weight loss, lower chronic disease riskConsuming adequate dietary fiber is associated with various health benefits.For instance, fiber supports healthy digestion and feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut, Landau explained. This, in turn, can help regulate hormones, including those that influence mood and body weight.Fiber also helps manage blood sugar and cholesterol levels, making it a valuable resource for potentially reducing the risk of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.“Dietary fiber has also been seen to play a protective role against some cancers,” Landau said. Indeed, high fiber intake is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer. Additionally, a recent study suggests that higher intakes of dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates are associated with healthy aging and longevity in women.Who should avoid fibermaxxing?High fiber diets may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain health conditions.Those who are older than 50, have health conditions like short bowel syndrome, pelvic prolapse, and others may feel worse on a high fiber diet, Marin said. If you meet any of these criteria, you should consult with your doctor before increasing your fiber intake.“People with existing gut conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and more may need to temporarily reduce their fiber intake, then add more fiber to their diets slowly and strategically to prevent any adverse gut symptoms,” Marin advised.She additionally suggested that a reverse elimination diet may be beneficial in order to increase tolerance and allow time for gut healing.“Generally, this trend is a great idea to encourage increased fiber intake, therefore preventing future gut issues, however, it may not be appropriate for everyone,” Marin said.How to boost your fiber intakeMarin said you can add more dietary fiber to your diet by simply increasing the amount of plant foods you consume.“Aim to have at least one fiber-rich food with each meal and snack,” she suggested.Some of Marin’s favorite high fiber foods include: kiwichiadragon fruitwhole grainsbeans and legumescarrotsblueberriessweet potatoesoatskalebroccoliavocadosLandau added that if you’re looking at packaged foods that promote higher fiber levels, you’ll want to read the label to ensure that there is a range of ingredients that could be providing the fiber rather than one isolated fiber at the top of the ingredient list.Some examples to look out for include: soluble corn fiberchicory root inulinpolydextrose“This is recommended to both prevent digestive troubles as well as help promote the feeding of a range of probiotics in your gut that all preferentially consume and thrive off different prebiotic fiber sources,” she explained.Landau further noted that older adults who have built up a tolerance may be able to receive benefits from a higher fiber intake, provided that the fiber is coming from a variety of whole foods, including: vegetablesfruitswhole grainslegumeslentilsnutsseeds“I would recommend people do not simply look at the number of grams of fiber in any product, but rather the diversity in fibers, coming from different sources, and offering both soluble and insoluble fibers to mitigate digestive distress,” she said.If you’re just starting to increase your fiber intake, you should also increase your water consumption. This will help keep your digestive tract moving so you can pass any undesirable gas or bloating, Landau said.Experts say most people may benefit from fibermaxxingFibermaxxing may be trending on TikTok, but the science behind it holds water. Boosting your daily fiber intake may offer a wide range of health benefits, from better blood sugar management and improved digestion to hormone balance and even chronic disease prevention.Fiber also promotes satiety, which can promote weight loss and healthy weight management.Experts agree that most people could benefit from eating more plant-based, fiber-rich foods.However, jumping into a high fiber lifestyle without preparation can backfire, especially for people with sensitive guts, those taking certain medical conditions, or adults over 50.The key is to personalize your approach: increase fiber gradually, drink more water, and prioritize a variety of whole food sources. Labels can help, but diversity in fiber types — from fruits and veggies to legumes and grains — matters more than the grams alone.Before you follow the trend, listen to your gut — literally. With a bit of strategy, fibermaxxing can be a smart, sustainable upgrade to your daily routine rather than a rough ride through your digestive system.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Nancy Schimelpfening, MS on May 28, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextIs Okra Water Actually Healthy?

Steve Christo – Corbis/Getty ImagesResearchers report that people taking GLP-1 drugs in daily life don’t lose as much weight as those in clinical trials who take the same medications.The researchers add that people using weight loss drugs don’t regain weight as quickly as those in clinical trials.One possible reason for the weight loss differential is that people in the “real world” tend to stop taking these medications sooner than people in clinical trials.People who use commonly prescribed weight loss medications don’t lose as much weight as participants in clinical trials, but they also don’t regain weight as quickly.That’s the conclusion of a new study published on June 10 in the journal Obesity.The study authors reported that the weight loss differential was mainly due to the fact that people tend to stop using GLP-1 drugs sooner than clinical trial participants. They also tend to use lower doses of these medications.The researchers also reported that A1C blood level reductions were similar for both groups of people.The researchers noted that they will initiate further research into what other measures, such as lifestyle changes or bariatric surgery, people may have adopted after discontinuing weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound.The researchers also want to look into why people stopped using weight loss drugs before their program regimen ended.“Our findings indicate that treatment discontinuation and use of lower maintenance dosages might reduce the likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful weight reduction in patients who initiate obesity pharmacotherapy with semaglutide or tirzepatide,” the study authors wrote.“Our findings could inform the decisions of healthcare providers and their patients on the role of treatment discontinuation and maintenance dosage in achieving clinically meaningful weight loss,” they added.‘Real world’ use of weight loss medicationsFor their study, researchers looked at the health records of 7,881 adults with obesity or weight management issues who did not have type 2 diabetes.Those people were seen between 2021 and 2023 at the Cleveland Clinic’s facilities in Ohio and Florida. Their average age was about 51 years. Nearly 80% of the subjects were white.Of those participants, 6,109 were prescribed a weight loss medication such as Wegovy with the active ingredient semaglutide. The other 1,772 were prescribed a weight loss drug, such as Zepbound, with the active ingredient tirzepatide.About 80% of those subjects were given low doses of their weekly injectable weight loss medications.Researchers reported significant differences between people using weight loss medications in phase 3 clinical trials and those taking the drugs in the “real world.”For starters, about half of those taking either medication in daily life stopped within the first 12 months. About 51% of those using a tirzepatide drug discontinued its use in that same time period.That compares with only 17% of semaglutide users and between 14% and 16% of tirzepatide users in clinical trials who quit during the first year.In addition, the average weight reduction for semaglutide participants in daily life was nearly 8% after one year while it was 12% for people taking tirzepatide.By comparison, the average weight loss in clinical trials was nearly 15% for semaglutide subjects as well as 15% for people on low dose tirzepatide and 20% for those on a higher dose of that medication.In general, weight loss was greater in people who took weight loss medications for a longer period of time.In addition, about 54% of people who had prediabetes at the start of their treatment plan improved to healthier A1C levels after one year. Around 3% of those studied progressed to type 2 diabetes after 12 months.Weight loss is a long-term commitmentMir Ali, MD, a surgeon and bariatric surgeon as well as the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California, said the main takeaway from this study is that weight loss is a long-term commitment. Ali wasn’t involved in the new study.“The long-term use of medications is more effective than short-term use,” Ali told Healthline. “The study confirms that obesity is a chronic condition like diabetes or hypertension.”Sarah Kim, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, noted that discontinuing medication is common for people being treated for obesity and other conditions. Kim was likewise not involved in the new study.Kim added that adherence to medication schedules as well as diet and exercise programs isn’t as easy in real life because people don’t have the supervision and support a person gets during a clinical trial.“Real life is different and results aren’t always as spectacular as in clinical trials,” Kim told Healthline.Kim and Ali agreed that another reason people stop taking medications is that these drugs can be expensive, even if insurance is picking up part of the cost.There is also the fact that the side effects from these medications can be severe for some people. Plus, people in real life sometimes just get tired of the obligation of taking a pill or injecting themselves on a regular basis.Ali and Kim also noted that people need to realize that medications are only a tool to help them eat less. To lose weight and keep it off, a person needs to adopt lifestyle habits such as a healthy diet and regular exercise.“The medications are not a short-term kickstart. They don’t burn fat,” said Kim. “The medications just help with the suppression of hunger.”“The ultimate goal of the medications is to give people a tool to get them to a healthy weight,” Ali added.What to know about GLP-1 drug for weight lossGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) work by mimicking a hormone in the body that helps regulate blood sugar levels and reduces hunger pangs.One class of the newer GLP-1 medications uses the active ingredient semaglutide. They are sold under different brand names. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been approved to treat type 2 diabetes. Wegovy is approved for use in weight management. Semaglutide drugs are available as both oral tablets and injections.The other newer group uses the active ingredient tirzepatide. Mounjaro is approved to treat type 2 diabetes. Zepbound is approved for use in weight management. These medications are available only as injections.Previous studies have highlighted the effectiveness of these drugs on helping people lose weight.Past research has also indicated that these weight loss drugs can help lower a person’s risk of cancer as well as provide benefits to heart health and brain health.Experts say the medications have proven to be effective and their use is likely to increase.“This is a massive market and it’s not going to go away,” Ali said. “These medications are going to continue to be a big part of weight loss programs.”Learn more about how to get GLP-1 medications from vetted and trusted online sources here:Where to Buy Ozempic OnlineWhere to Buy Ozempic OnlineHow to Get Mounjaro (Tirzepatide)Where to Buy Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) OnlineHow to Get Wegovy for Weight Loss In Person and OnlineHow to Get a Wegovy Prescription OnlineHow to Get Zepbound: What We Know So FarWhere to Buy Zepbound OnlineHow we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by David Mills on June 20, 2025 — Fact checked by Jill Seladi-Schulman, Ph.D.Read this nextZepbound More Effective for Weight Loss Than Wegovy, Eli Lilly Trial ShowsTirzepatide (Zepbound) led to more weight loss than semaglutide (Wegovy) in a clinical trial funded by Eli Lilly.

Tashdique Mehtaj Ahmed/Getty ImagesHeart attacks have become more survivable in the past 50 years, and are no longer the leading cause of heart disease-related deaths, a new study reports.As heart attack deaths fall, fatalities from other heart conditions are rising due to various factors, including higher rates of other forms of cardiovascular disease.In recent decades, deaths from heart disease have still been responsible for more U.S. fatalities than any other cause.Heart attacks are no longer the number one cause of heart-related deaths in the United States, according to a new report.Fatalities from heart attacks — acute myocardial infarctions — decreased by 89% from 1970 to 2022, the report, published on June 25 in the Journal of the American Heart Association, shows.Heart attacks are severe ischemic heart disease events in which blood flow to and from the heart is restricted. Ischemic heart disease was responsible for 91% of all heart disease-related deaths in 1970, declining to 53% by 2022.Heart disease overall has decreased by 66% since 1970, yet it remains the leading cause of death among Americans.With more people avoiding death from myocardial infarctions (MI), fatalities from other heart disease subtypes now represent 81% of heart-related deaths. These include:heart failure, for which fatalities have increased by 81%hypertension-related heart disease deaths, which have risen by 106%arrhythmia-related fatalities, which have increased by 450%Heart attack deaths drop in recent decadesJayne Morgan, MD, cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs for Hello Heart, told Healthline that the report does not indicate that fewer heart attacks are occurring. Morgan wasn’t involved in the new report.“I did not note a decline in myocardial infarctions themselves, but rather a decline in heart attacks being the primary cause of death,” she said. “As Americans, we are not that great at prevention. Our strength has been in the science and application of medicine.”“The inference is that more and more heart attacks are survivable now as compared to 55 years ago,” Morgan said.This is because emergency physicians have become better at saving people experiencing heart attacks with the help of contemporary medications, lifesaving procedures, and devices.Deaths from non-fatal heart attacksMorgan explained that the non-fatal heart attack “was the catalyst for the chain of events leading to eventual long-term chronic heart disease conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias.”“Patients who otherwise would have passed from their heart attack are now surviving, and then living longer dealing with the consequences,” Cheng-Han Chen, MD, board certified interventional cardiologist, told Healthline. Chen wasn’t involved in the new report.Chen described heart-muscle damage that non-fatal heart attacks often leave in their wake. The extent of that damage depends on the severity and duration of the attack. Weakness in the heart muscle can result in heart failure.It’s important to understand that heart failure does not mean that a heart has completely failed. Rather, it means that it is no longer functioning as well as it once did.“Heart failure is a spectrum in which the heart just doesn’t work perfectly,” said Chen. “It could be very mild, or it could be very severe and everything in-between.”“You can actually live with mild heart failure for the remainder of your life,” said Chen, “and it doesn’t really affect you that much, and you can control it with medication.”Another obvious result of non-fatal heart attacks is that people who survive them tend to live longer. Heart failure, hypertension-related heart disease, and arrhythmia are all associated with aging. Living longer only increases the odds of eventually developing these conditions.Lifestyle factors impact heart healthThe typical American lifestyle puts many people at a high risk for heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmia, Morgan noted.It is characterized, she said, by “obesity, hypertension, sedentary lifestyles, processed and palatable fast food, decreased physical movement, smoking, cholesterol, diabetes, as well as societal stressors leading to chronic inflammation.”She noted that socioeconomic issues complicate lifestyle risk factors and make addressing them especially difficult for many.“This includes pregnancy complications such as hypertension of pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, etc.,” Morgan added. “These all increase a woman’s lifetime risk of heart disease, and are still the primary drivers of maternal mortality outcomes.”The general decline in heart fatalities, however, indicates that some progress is being made against some of these risk factors.Sharp increase in arrhythmia-related deathsThe report found the most dramatic increase in arrhythmia-related deaths. Arrhythmias are disorders in which the rate at which the heart beats is abnormal. There are four main types of arrhythmia:bradycardia — slow heart ratetachycardia — fast heart rate ventricular arrhythmia — begins in the ventriclessupraventricular arrhythmia — begins above the ventricles (i.e., atrial fibrillation or irregular heartbeat)Arrhythmias are common and are often harmless. However, should an arrhythmia interfere with the heart’s ability to maintain blood flow, damage may occur to the heart, brain, lungs, and other vital organs. As the report describes, arrhythmias can be fatal.It is important to get annual checkups that include a heart-health examination.In addition, if you can feel your heart is beating without having your hand on your chest, it is a good idea to consult your doctor to be checked for arrhythmia.This is especially essential for heart-attack survivors. “Reducing the risk of arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction is crucial, as these irregular heart rhythms — especially ventricular arrhythmias — can be life threatening,” Morgan said.She cited several interventions that can help the survivor of a non-fatal heart attack avoid death from arrhythmia, including a four-drug combo known as the “foundational four” for managing HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction). Morgan said statins, cardiac rehab, implantable defibrillators, sleep apnea management, and lifestyle changes may also be valuable in such cases.AHA’s tips for staying heart-healthyThe American Heart Association (AHA) provides an eight-step framework for maintaining heart health:eat healthybe more activequit tobaccoget healthy sleepmanage your weightcontrol your cholesterolregulate your blood sugarmanage your blood pressureFor more information, visit the AHA’s Essential Eight website.

There’s a good chance that you’ve eaten palm oil or used products made with it. It’s used for cooking and as an ingredient in foods like crackers, butter substitutes, and frozen foods, as well as products like soap, shampoo, makeup, and even biofuel (1).However, the methods used to produce palm oil are highly unsustainable and wreak havoc on the environment of Southeast Asia.Nevertheless, the palm oil industry claims that this crop plays a significant role in the food system and provides jobs in the countries where it’s grown.As a dietitian concerned with the future of our global food system, I want to take an in-depth look at palm oil’s environmental impact, as it’s clear that our current use of palm oil isn’t sustainable long term.This article reviews some pressing sustainability issues with palm oil and explores a few ways that you can advocate for better production practices. Share on PinterestGlowimages/Getty ImagesWhy palm oil is so popularMany of us don’t realize just how common palm oil is. In 2021, the world produced more than 167 million pounds (75.7 million kg) of it (2).Palm is already the most used vegetable oil in the world, and demand for it is only expected to grow (3).This oil rose in popularity during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries and again over the past few decades as manufacturers began looking for versatile ingredients to replace trans fats in processed foods.Palm oil not only acts as a preservative but also remains stable under high temperatures and has a mild flavor and smooth texture. Plus, growing and harvesting it is cost-effective. As the food industry realized palm oil’s perks, its use increased greatly during the 1970s and 1980s. This oil is now used in as many as half of all consumer goods (4).SUMMARYPalm oil’s use has grown exponentially over the past few decades. It’s hidden in many more products and foods than we tend to realize due to its versatile uses and effectiveness as a high volume crop.The environmental cost of palm oilJust a few counties — mainly Indonesia and Malaysia — produce nearly 85% of the planet’s palm oil (2). Parts of Southeastern Asia, Africa, and Latin America where palm oil is grown are most affected by its production. Even so, because its impacts on the environment are so significant, the final toll of palm oil production may be much further reaching (5).Here are some of the most notable environmental concerns involving palm oil:Deforestation. In some parts of Asia, palm oil is estimated to cause nearly half of all deforestation. Clear-cutting forests for agriculture releases greenhouse gases, leads to the destruction of habits, and threatens biodiversity (5, 6, 7, 8).Pollution. The large-scale production of an agricultural commodity like palm oil inevitably leads to runoff and pollution of nearby soil and waterways. Deforestation to make way for palm oil crops is also a major source of air pollution (4, 9, 10).Loss of biodiversity. As a result of deforestation and habitat loss, many bird, elephant, orangutan, and tiger populations are becoming increasingly threatened or endangered in countries that produce palm oil (8, 11, 12, 13).Contributes to global warming. Clear-cutting forests to establish palm oil plantations contributes to global warming by releasing excessive amounts of greenhouse gases into the air (6, 8).Unmitigated growth and production. Palm oil demand is projected to keep rising over the next 10 years. Production could grow by 100% or more in some areas, only worsening its environmental toll (5, 7).Paradoxically, palm oil production is threatened by global warming, too. Not only do some palm varieties grow poorly in warmer temperatures, but flooding from rising sea levels also threatens palm-oil-producing countries like Indonesia (14).SUMMARYThe palm oil industry is responsible for huge amounts of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution. As the industry continues to grow, these issues may only intensify.How palm oil is regulatedPalm oil production is lightly regulated — and sometimes not regulated at all. This situation gives rise to tensions between corporate interests and consumers or environmental groups demanding changes to how palm oil is made.Regulating palm oil may lead to higher prices for consumer goods, lower wages, and a loss of work for people who grow palm oil. Yet, excessive carbon emissions, such as those released by deforestation, are a threat to society as we know it (9, 15, 16, 17).These are just a few issues to consider when it comes to regulating palm oil.Researchers have proposed reducing the industry’s emissions by only using land that has already been forested for palm plantations, protecting the most carbon-rich lands like peat forests, and better managing carbon-sensitive areas (18, 19, 20, 21).A few key playersIn the private sector, organizations like the European Palm Oil Alliance (EPOA) are making commitments against deforestation, land exploitation, and peat forest development. Grocery stores like Iceland Foods have reformulated store-brand items to remove palm oil (7).In some instances, governments have stepped in. The 2015 Amsterdam Declaration aimed to phase out all palm oil that isn’t certified sustainable by 2020. The partnership now includes nine countries, including France and the United Kingdom, and has expanded its commitment to eliminating agricultural deforestation (22).Despite these efforts, enforcement is challenging due to corporate influence and a lack of resources.For example, efforts like the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) were less successful. Advertised as a commitment to stop deforestation and the development of peat forests, the IPOP was signed by Indonesia’s largest palm oil exporters in 2014 (23). The initiative fell apart just a few years later due to a lack of organization and external pressure from the industry. Some activists criticized the effort as little more than a political advertising stunt that only increased red tape around sustainability efforts.SUMMARYCurrently, no one regulatory body oversees global palm oil production. Some nations have committed to using only sustainable palm oil, while private groups are advocating for a halt to deforestation and the development of carbon-rich lands.Should you avoid palm oil?It’s a personal choice whether you decide to avoid palm oil or try to only use palm oils that have been sustainably and ethically sourced.Many of the controversies surrounding palm oil involve:the environmentclimate changesustainable agricultureIndigenous people’s right to manage their landhuman rightsworkers’ rightchild labor lawsIt’s clear that palm oil production in its current form isn’t sustainable long term.Furthermore, organizations like Amnesty International, the International Labor Rights Forum, and Human Rights Watch have accused the palm oil industry of using child labor, failing to protect the lands of Indigenous people, and other human rights abuses.Still, simply replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils may not be a viable option (5).That’s because other vegetable oil crops would likely use even more resources — and thus contribute more to climate change — than palm oil does, as palm crops grow efficiently and have a significantly higher output than other oil-producing plants.What if it’s grown responsibly?If palm oil were produced ethically and sustainably, it could offer numerous benefits. Aside from being an effective cooking oil, it works well as a soap and fuel. Plus, people have been cooking with palm oil in Africa for thousands of years (1, 24). Palm oil also has nutritional benefits because it contains healthy fats, numerous antioxidants, and vitamins A and E. Unrefined palm oil, also called red palm oil, may contain the most amount of nutrients since it’s cold pressed rather than heated during processing (25, 26, 27, 28).Nevertheless, research on palm oil’s nutrients is conflicting. It may be healthiest when used in place of other less healthy fats like trans fats (29, 30, 31, 32).SUMMARYPalm oil is rich in healthy fats, some vitamins, and antioxidants. Though it can be part of a healthy diet, some people choose to limit it or use only sustainably grown palm oil due to the industry’s environmental and human rights abuses.How to spot palm oil — and advocate for changeYou can advocate against the harmful effects of palm oil in the following ways.1. Familiarize yourself with the names of palm oilKnowing how to spot palm oil on an ingredient list is essential to understanding how common it is and learning where it might be hiding in your own diet, hygiene, or wellness routine.It’s also key if you’ve decided to cut back your use of palm oil.Some of the most common ingredients derived from palm oil are:palmatepalmitatesodium laureth sulfate (sometimes contains palm oil)sodium lauryl sulfate (sometimes contains palm oil)glyceryl stearatestearic acidvegetable oil (sometimes contains palm oil)2. Know your certificationsPurchasing palm oil that has been certified sustainable by an accrediting body lets industry leaders know that consumers are concerned about these issues.Some certifications may be designated by an icon on product labels. A few of the most common include:The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Palm oil producers must verify that their production processes meet the sustainability criteria set out by the RSPO.International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). Certified organizations must commit to halting deforestation, protecting soil and water, and safeguarding human and workers’ rights.The Rainforest Alliance. Farms must meet standards in various areas of social, economic, and environmental sustainability.Malaysia and Indonesia each have government-led certification programs. The Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Certification. The national certification of Malaysia reviews palm oil processing plants for certain management and supply chain standards.The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) Certification. This effort by the Indonesian government certifies sustainable growers in the country.Still, environmental advocates have questioned the credibility of such programs due to the influence of the palm oil industry (33).3. Request transparency from the palm oil industryDon’t be afraid to reach out directly to palm oil producers, distributors, and companies that use palm oil in their products. Ask key players in the industry about their practices and encourage them to move toward sustainable palm oil.By signing online petitions, sending emails, or joining protests, you can encourage companies that rely on palm oil to adopt sustainability principles.4. Keep up the pressurePolicies to promote sustainable palm oilGovernment policy can be wielded to stop deforestation and promote sustainable palm oil. Specific policies that would lessen palm oil’s environmental impact include:Bans on deforestation. Creating national parks, limiting clearcutting practices, and banning deforestation in fragile areas would protect rainforests and critical ecosystems.Stricter trade criteria. Countries could decide to only import palm oil and palm oil products grown in a sustainable manner.Land use regulation. Governments could mandate that palm plantations only be developed on land that has already been forested for several years. Sustainability promises and certifications are a step in the right direction, but the palm oil industry needs a systematic overhaul to remain viable into the future. Standing up to a major industry like the palm oil lobby might feel like a daunting task, but you won’t be alone. When ordinary citizens band together for a cause they’re passionate about, they can achieve extraordinary things. Some ways to campaign for change around palm oil include:Signing petitions. Environmental groups like Greenpeace organize online petitions to stop the harmful impacts of palm oil. Joining protests. You may be able to find a community group that helps raise awareness of palm oil’s effects. Other ways to advocate include avoiding palm oil or lobbying elected officials on its issues. Spreading the word. Many people are still unaware of the harmful effects palm oil has on communities and the environment. You can be an advocate for change by helping educate others on palm oil. SUMMARYYou can advocate for sustainable palm oil by limiting how much you use it, buying products that are certified sustainable, requesting transparency from the palm oil industry, and putting pressure on its main players to find sustainable alternatives. The bottom linePalm oil is abundant in the food system and common household products.However, its environmental impact is profound. Although certain concrete steps, such as halting deforestation and growing palm only on previously forested lands, could reduce palm oil’s environmental impacts, the palm oil industry has so far resisted these changes.Thus, if you’re worried about the impact palm oil is having on the world around you, you can take action by limiting your palm oil usage and purchasing products that are certified as sustainable.Just one thingTry this today: Scan the foods in your pantry, the soaps on your shelves, and the cosmetics in your bag to locate hidden sources of palm oil in your home. Don’t forget to look for ingredients like palmate, glyceryl, stearate, and sodium lauryl sulfate. How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleMedically reviewed by Kim Rose-Francis RDN, CDCES, LD — Written by Cecilia Snyder, MS, RD  on June 4, 2021Read this nextPalm Oil: Does It Have Health Benefit?Written by Franziska SpritzlerPalm oil is a popular oil found in many foods.

Warwick, RDN, CDCES — Written by Jillian Kubala, MS, RD  on October 27, 2020As a dietitian, I’ve been treating people with autoimmune conditions, including Hashimoto’s disease, for years.Hashimoto’s is the most common type of hypothyroidism in the United States. It’s an autoimmune disease that damages the thyroid, a gland that releases hormones that control metabolism, growth, and a number of other bodily functions.Through my patients, I knew how difficult Hashimoto’s disease could be to diagnose, treat, and manage. However, I had no idea just how much this disease affects physical and mental health until I was diagnosed myself.Here’s my story.Share on PinterestCourtesy of Jillian KubalaVague symptoms I started to feel off in the summer of 2019. I couldn’t sleep, was so tired during the day that I could barely finish my work, and felt hungover every morning even though I wasn’t drinking alcohol at the time.I was also experiencing strange heart flutters, anxiety, brain fog, difficulty concentrating, extreme cold intolerance, joint pain, air hunger (a feeling of shortness of breath), and many other vague symptoms. Over the next several months, I visited a number of specialists, including a cardiologist, pulmonologist, and rheumatologist. Every test came back normal aside from my white blood cell count, which was low. I was also slightly anemic. Side noteSome people with Hashimoto’s disease have normal or only borderline low thyroid values in lab results. That’s because the thyroid destruction that happens during Hashimoto’s disease is intermittent.Some of the doctors I saw were dismissive and chalked my symptoms up to stress and anxiety, which — by the way — is extremely common for people with Hashimoto’s. After hearing several doctors tell me that everything was normal, I thought I was losing my mind. I started to question myself. Were these symptoms seriously caused by stress and anxiety? No. I knew my body, and I knew that something was wrong.Getting a diagnosis can be difficult As a last ditch effort, I made an appointment with an infectious disease doctor because I live on the East End of Long Island, where ticks are abundant. I thought my symptoms could be due to Lyme disease.This doctor ran bloodwork, including a thyroid panel. As a dietitian, I like to review my own results as soon as they’re available. When I saw that my T3 was low, I called an endocrinologist with whom I work closely and made an appointment. She was the one who finally diagnosed me with Hashimoto’s disease after an ultrasound of my thyroid and bloodwork that showed low levels of T3, a thyroid hormone, and elevated thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. Getting a diagnosis took me about 7 months, which is very common for people with Hashimoto’s disease. I was so relieved to get a diagnosis after months of being told that my symptoms were basically all in my head. But I was also worried about my health and resentful about the diagnosis. Aside from having Raynaud’s syndrome, which reduces blood flow to the fingers and toes, and exercise-induced asthma as a kid, I was a healthy person with limitless energy. I took very good care of my health, exercised, didn’t smoke, and grew my own food. However, I knew far too well that autoimmune conditions, as well as serious medical conditions in general, can affect anyone — even people who are physically healthy. My endocrinologist thinks that, in my case, a viral infection triggered my Hashimoto’s disease. She started me on Armour Thyroid, a natural thyroid hormone replacement medication.Side noteAlthough researchers are still unsure about the exact cause of Hashimoto’s, multiple factors, including genetic vulnerability and environmental triggers, are thought to be involved.Feeling better takes timeShare on PinterestCourtesy of Jillian KubalaAfter starting on Armour, I thought I would start feeling better within a few weeks. Yet, although some of my symptoms like severe cold intolerance and joint pain improved, I was still feeling awful after about a month or so on the same dose.Symptoms persisting even with medication is also prevalent among those with Hashimoto’s. Although some people respond well to medication and start feeling like their old selves, others continue experiencing significant symptoms that affect their quality of life even when their thyroid function is considered normal. In fact, many endocrinologists and researchers recognize that symptoms alone aren’t usually used to assess the effectiveness of treatment — laboratory values are. Therefore, medications are prescribed and adjusted based on these values, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Thankfully, my doctor expressed interest in how I was feeling and whether my symptoms were being controlled. She was always open to trying new medications and doses until we found a treatment that made me feel better. When I told her that I was still experiencing significant symptoms, she increased my dosage. After another few weeks, I finally started to feel better and get my energy back.Dietary changes and supplements can help, but they’re not magic pills After starting the initial dose of medication, I also tried dietary and supplement protocols that I had previously encouraged my patients with Hashimoto’s disease to implement. These regimens had worked wonders for some of them — but not all.Like anything else I recommend to my patients, these supplements and protocols are based on scientific research.Side noteIt’s important to work with a dietitian when making changes to your diet or supplement protocol. It’s just as necessary to let your healthcare provider know if you start taking supplements. Experimenting with dietsI first tried the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet, which was shown to improve quality of life and significantly reduce markers of inflammation in people with Hashimoto’s in a 2019 research study. I followed the protocol strictly, but it didn’t significantly improve my symptoms. To be honest, I already ate plant-centric, paleo-style meals for many years before I was diagnosed. Not only did this eating pattern help manage my Raynaud’s syndrome symptoms, but it also made me feel my best.Although I added back certain grains, some cheeses, and legumes, which are eliminated in AIP, I continued to avoid gluten and returned to my normal diet, which consists of plenty of veggies, fruits, healthy fats, and protein sources like fish, eggs, and chicken. As a gluten-free diet has been shown to improve thyroid function and reduce thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s, I suggest that all of my patients with Hashimoto’s try this diet for at least a few months to see if their symptoms and disease markers improve.Experimenting with supplementsFor supplements, I again turned to research to find the most evidence-based approach. Since I had been treating people with Hashimoto’s, I knew that anti-inflammatory supplements like fish oil and certain nutrients like zinc, selenium, and magnesium may be helpful.I also knew that people with Hashimoto’s are more likely to be deficient in certain nutrients like vitamins B12 and D. I was already taking a vitamin D/K2 supplement, B complex vitamin, and magnesium glycinate, so I added in selenium, zinc, and high dose fish oil.Like the dietary changes, these supplements didn’t make me feel significantly better. However, certain beneficial changes can’t be determined solely by how you feel. In general, taking certain supplements and following an anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense diet may improve thyroid function, inflammation, and overall health.Being treated with medication, taking certain supplements, and adhering to a nutrient-dense diet did help me feel better over time. Remember that managing an autoimmune disease is a marathon, not a sprint.Further infoExplore more dietary and supplement tips for Hashimoto’s disease in my comprehensive, science-based article here.What has worked for me Finding the right medication and dosage, following a nutritious diet, and taking supplements have significantly improved my quality of life.Plus, giving my body time to recover was key.When I was first diagnosed, I didn’t have the energy to exercise or do my favorite hobbies like hiking and gardening, so I let myself rest. A lot of guilt and frustration accompanies feeling too unwell to do things that you love, being unable to exercise, and struggling to fully engage in life, which can take a toll on your relationships with friends and family. I felt lazy and like I needed to push myself to do things. However, I quickly realized that letting myself rest when I needed to and showing myself compassion was much more important for my health. I took it easy until I started to feel better. Although I’m mostly back to my normal energy levels and don’t experience significant symptoms that often, I still have off days when I know I need to let myself rest, and that’s OK.What may help youI know what makes me feel worse — drinking alcohol, not getting enough sleep, and being overly stimulated or stressed. This is also true for many of my patients who have Hashimoto’s.And here’s what makes me and most of my patients feel better:spending time outside stretching and restorative activities like yogaeating lots of anti-inflammatory foods, especially veggiesfollowing a nutrient-dense diettaking hot Epsom salt bathsstaying hydratedavoiding caffeine and alcohol as much as possibleengaging in stress-reducing activities like gardening and hikinggetting plenty of sleeptaking certain supplements staying activeletting myself rest when I’m not feeling wellGenerally, following a nutritious, anti-inflammatory diet, reducing stress, and leading a healthy lifestyle are likely to reduce certain Hashimoto’s symptoms. However, it’s important to note that no specific diet is currently recommended to treat Hashimoto’s disease. Just because something works for one person doesn’t mean it works for others, which is one reason why self-experimentation is so important. It’s essential to get the right care  Share on PinterestCourtesy of Jillian KubalaI’m lucky that my endocrinologist is a wonderful doctor and personal friend with whom I feel comfortable asking questions and talking openly about my health. For many people, this isn’t the case.I’ve had patients who’ve been dismissed by numerous doctors, misdiagnosed, and not properly treated. Unfortunately, this is very common. In fact, up to one-third of people with hypothyroidism doesn’t receive adequate treatment.As mentioned above, it’s not uncommon for people to see multiple doctors before being diagnosed. Even after diagnosis, many people aren’t comfortable telling their doctor that their medication isn’t effective and that they’re still experiencing symptoms. It may take your doctor several attempts to get the dosing and medication right before you start feeling better. Make sure you choose a specialist with whom you feel comfortable discussing your symptoms and treatment options.You have the right to ask questions about your health, and your doctor should take your symptoms seriously. There are so many excellent doctors out there. If you’re uncomfortable with your provider, find another one. Some people find success by working only with an endocrinologist, others feel better after working with a dietitian to overhaul their diet and lifestyle, and still others prefer to see a functional medicine practitioner. Remember that you always have options. Use them.Moreover, try to work with a dietitian who specializes in hypothyroidism or autoimmune diseases if you decide to experiment with diet and supplements. These experts can help you determine the best regimen for your needs.Be your own advocateYou need to be your own health advocate. This is important for everyone with a medical condition to keep in mind. You know your body best. If you think there’s something wrong, keep digging. Don’t give up. Find a healthcare provider who’s thorough and listens to you. I know that going to numerous doctor’s appointments can be frustrating and time-consuming, as can trying various medications, dietary patterns, and supplements. Yet, I also know that these things are essential to improving your health and managing your symptoms. Lastly, remember that you’re not alone. Get help when you need it from friends, family, and healthcare providers. We’re all here to listen and support you on your path to feeling better.

They may also ask you to keep an app-based or written sleep log for 2 to 4 weeks, tracking:what time you go to bedthe approximate time it takes you to fall asleepany instances of repeated waking in the nightwhat time you wake up each dayThey may order medical tests or blood work to help rule out medical conditions that can interfere with sleep.If they suspect you could have an underlying sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea, they may recommend a sleep study.You’ll likely receive a clinical diagnosis of insomnia if your sleep difficulties occur at least 3 nights a week for a minimum of 3 months and if they create major distress or difficulties in your daily life.Treating insomniaYou have several options for treating insomnia, including therapy, medications, supplements, and natural remedies.Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends CBT-I as a first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults.With support from a therapist, you can learn specific techniques to address insomnia, including:Stimulus control: teaches you to get out of bed and find a quiet and relaxing activity until you feel sleepy, limiting the time you may lie awake and worry about falling asleepSleep restriction: restricts and then gradually increases the amount of time you spend in bedBright light therapy: exposes you to bright light in the morning or evening, depending on whether you have more trouble falling asleep or staying asleepA therapist may also offer guidance on relaxation techniques and sleep hygiene practices that address behaviors that prevent you from getting quality sleep.A therapist can also identify underlying mental health symptoms contributing to insomnia or making your symptoms worse. Addressing these triggers and contributing factors can go a long way toward relieving insomnia.Medications and supplementsYour clinician might prescribe medication (or Z-drugs) if therapy and lifestyle changes don’t work. Example medications include:eszopiclone (Lunesta)zolpidem (Ambien)triazolam (Halcion)They may recommend a medication in combination with therapy with the goal of ultimately sleeping without medication.Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements like melatonin can offer some relief from insomnia. Melatonin supplements may slightly decrease the time it takes you to fall asleep.Support for melatonin as an insomnia treatment remains inconclusive. Experts have yet to confirm whether it’s safe to use melatonin long term, though it’s generally considered safe for short-term use.Check in with a healthcare professional before trying supplements like melatonin or OTC medications to help ease insomnia. These medications may interact with other prescription and OTC medications or cause side effects.If you’re pregnant, always ask your healthcare team before taking any medications or supplements. Other approachesLifestyle changes and home remedies can often help manage insomnia symptoms. You can try:Natural sleep aids: Before bed, try warm milk, herbal tea, or valerian. Relaxing essential oil aromatherapy using oils like lavender and peppermint may also offer some sleep benefits.Meditation: Promote relaxation with mindful meditation. It improves sleep quality and relieves stress, which might contribute to insomnia.

Frequent, vivid dreams may be related to stress, medications, sleep disorders, or early pregnancy.While we think of sleep as a time for recharging the body, the brain is actually quite active during sleep — dreaming. Our dreams can be soothing or scary, mysterious or helpful, and realistic or fantastical.Sometimes we wake up and have no idea that we’ve dreamed, while other times, we can closely recall our dreams because they were so intense. These are known as vivid dreams.What causes vivid dreams?Brain scientists aren’t sure why humans dream in the first place, but they think it has something to do with memory.Dreaming might help the brain eliminate any unnecessary information or memories while processing and storing what’s important. Some people feel more refreshed after having slept and dreamed, even if they do not remember dreaming.People are most likely to remember the last dream they had in their sleep cycle. But it’s possible to remember a vivid dream long after it’s occurred if it seemed very intense.Vivid dreams can be positive or negative, realistic or fantasy. Scientists know that most heavy dreaming occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep normally cycles every 90 minutes during a night of sleep and may last 20 to 25 minutes.About 25% of an adult’s night of sleep is spent in REM cycles. The average adult should get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night for optimal health. That’s a lot of time for dreaming!So, what causes vivid dreams? Scientists aren’t completely sure. But they think the following factors may play a part.Stress or anxietyDifficulties real and imagined can cause a person to experience stress and anxiety in their daily life. Problems with friends, family, school, or work can trigger intense dreams as can big events like getting married or buying a house.Stressed caused by traumatic events, such as a death of a loved one, sexual abuse, or a car accident can also cause vivid dreams. Anxiety, in particular, is associated with an increased risk of disturbing and intense nightmares.Sleep disordersSleeping issues that cause a lack of sleep, such as insomnia and narcolepsy, can increase one’s risk of experiencing vivid dreams.Changes to your sleep schedule, such as flying overseas (and going to sleep at a different time) or getting less sleep than usual, can also increase this risk.MedicationsThere are some medications that have been reported to contribute to vivid dreams. These medications include many antidepressants, beta blockers, blood pressure medications, Parkinson’s disease drugs, and drugs to stop smoking.Substance abuseUsing alcohol in excess, using recreational drugs, or experiencing a withdrawal from drugs can trigger vivid dreams, often nightmares.Other health disordersIn addition to stress and anxiety, other mental health conditions, such as depression and schizophrenia, are associated with vivid dreams. Physical illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, have also been associated with vivid dreams.Early pregnancyPregnancy can trigger changes in the body’s hormone levels, sleep patterns, and emotions. Many pregnant women say they experience vivid dreams, especially during the early days of their pregnancy. What are the side effects of vivid dreams?Normally, vivid dreams are nothing to worry about. Sometimes they may only affect you during a certain part of your life.But negative vivid dreams, especially if they last for weeks or months, can be emotionally disturbing and disruptive to your sleep. And that can cause health problems.Some common side effects of vivid dreams include:Daytime sleepiness. This can cause concentration and memory problems that can affect your productivity at school or work. It can even affect your ability to carry out everyday tasks, such as driving or taking a shower. Even the smallest tasks can become dangerous if you get distracted.Mood problems. Vivid dreams can be emotionally draining, causing depression or anxiety symptoms. This can be an especially concerning problem if your vivid dreams persist over time.Resisting sleep. You may find that you consciously or subconsciously avoid going to bed or falling asleep because you fear you’ll have another bad dream.Suicidal attempts or thinking. Some people have reported suicidal thoughts (ideation) secondary to troubling dreams. This is extremely serious. If you have attempted or are considering suicide, get help from a crisis or suicide prevention hotline. Try the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255. It’s important to get help right away.National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8244If you or someone you know is considering suicide, call the number above or text TALK to 741741 to text with a trained crisis counselor for free, 24/7. Remember, you are not alone. Treatment and support can help. How are vivid dreams treated?It isn’t always possible to pinpoint an exact cause of vivid dreams. In many cases, these dreams will go away over time.But if your vivid dreams are causing you emotional distress or physical problems, you might benefit from medical treatment or lifestyle modifications.Schedule an appointment with your doctor or a sleep specialist to try to determine what treatments or lifestyle modifications are right for you.Here are some of the common treatments for vivid dreams.Medical intervention. If your vivid dreams are caused by an underlying mental or physical health condition, talk with a doctor about diagnosing and treating that condition. Most doctors don’t recommend use of medication to treat vivid dreams. However, in the case of nightmares induced by trauma, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a doctor may consider prescribing sleeping medication or anti-anxiety medication to help induce sleep.Image rehearsal therapy. This treatment therapy, done with a mental healthcare professional, involves changing the ending to a vivid dream or nightmare you remember when you’re awake until it no longer becomes threatening. Your mental healthcare provider will ask you to continue playing over the new, nonthreatening ending to the dream in your mind. This therapy is designed to reduce a person’s frequency of vivid dreams — especially nightmares.Staying healthy. Eating well, maintaining a healthy weight, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, drinking enough water, and looking after your mental health can help prevent vivid dreams.Coping with stress and anxiety. Everyone experiences stress and anxiety, but some people are better at coping with it than others. If you feel that your stress and anxiety levels are out of control, you might want to consider: meditationdeep breathingrelaxation techniquesart therapyexerciseother activities that can ease your stressFrequently asked questions about vivid dreamsWhy am I suddenly dreaming so vividly?Scientists are entirely sure what causes vivid dreams, but they believe the following factors may play a role:stress or anxietysleep disorderscertain medicationsearly pregnancysubstance abusemental health conditions (such as depression or schizophrenia)physical health disorders (such as cancer or heart disease)Do vivid dreams mean anything?Brain scientists do yet understand why we dream. They have discovered that if you wake up with vivid memories of your dreams, it typically means they occurred during REM sleep. REM sleep is when we tend to dream. The deepest NREM sleep is when the body fully relaxes and repairs itself. Learn about the stages of sleep here.Is it normal to have vivid dreams almost every night?Having a vivid dream every now and then is typically not something to be concerned about. However, if you are having vivid dreams every night, you may want to talk with a doctor to see if there is an underlying condition that might be causing these dreams to occur with such regularity.Do vivid dreams mean good sleep?Generally speaking, dreams you remember (such as vivid dreams), usually occur during REM sleep. But a good night’s sleep typically involves getting the right balance of sleep in each sleep stage. The five stages of sleep are: light NREM sleep, deep NREM sleep, and REM sleep. How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Connect with us for all things health.SubscribeWhat Are Foods to Avoid While on Chemotherapy?Medically reviewed by Imashi Fernando, MS, RDN, CDCES — Written by Hope Gillette  on September 5, 2023Foods to avoidFoods to eatDiet and chemoSummaryFew diets warn against the inclusion of raw vegetables, but if you’re wondering what foods to avoid while on chemotherapy, unwashed raw veggies, some egg products, and select cheeses make the list.Chemotherapy is a type of treatment that uses potent chemicals to disrupt the life cycle of fast-growing cancer cells. As a systemic, or whole-body therapy, it can also affect your overall health in ways beyond cancer treatment.Immune suppression is a common concern when it comes to chemotherapy side effects. Chemotherapy can change how well your bone marrow produces white blood cells — the cells that help you ward off infections.If you’re in an immune-compromised phase of treatment, monitoring what you eat can help reduce your risk of dangerous foodborne infections.What should you not eat during chemotherapy?Foods to avoid while on chemotherapy are those that may increase your risk of foodborne illnesses.Catalina Ruz Gatica, a registered dietitian who specializes in chronic illness at Top Nutrition Coaching in Chicago, explained, “For those undergoing chemotherapy, it’s particularly important to avoid foods such as undercooked or raw meats, raw fish, food past its expiration date, or unwashed produce.”Knowing which foods may be high risk can be tricky. Some products that may seem safe — such as Caesar salad dressing — can contain items like uncooked eggs.Dry-cured or smoked meatsProducts like dry-cured raw salami or smoked fish are preserved through drying, salting, and exposure to heat and smoke. While these processes can inhibit bacteria growth, they may not be as effective as high temperatures in killing all potentially harmful pathogens.According to the National Center for Home Food Preservation, for example, certain molds are resistant to salt and can grow inside cured meats after they’re sliced.Unpasteurized milk productsPasteurization is the heat-based sterilization process used for many commercially packaged, sealed foods, including:dairy productsjuicessandwich meatsegg productsnut buttersYou may want to avoid raw milk products, such as unpasteurized yogurt, during chemotherapy because they haven’t undergone sterilization. These products include soft or blue-veined cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, such as:blue cheesebriestiltonRoquefortGorgonzolaqueso blanco frescoOpen-case products and bulk-bin itemsSalads and meats stored in deli coolers for the day may be kept cold, but they’re potentially exposed to pathogens every time the door opens for an employee.The same goes for bulk-bin items, such as cereal, that you can dish out yourself. You may not know what these foods were exposed to when the last person opened the bin.Unwashed fruits, sprouts, and vegetablesFruits and vegetables can be an important part of getting nutrients during chemotherapy, but they should always be washed or cooked before consumption to avoid surface contaminants that may make you ill.This precaution includes packaged products made from fresh produce, such as salsas and unpasteurized “fresh squeezed” juices. Sprouts also need to be cooked because they have a higher risk of bacterial growth.Undercooked meatsCooking meat to the appropriate temperature is one of the safest food habits to perform during chemotherapy. High temperatures kill pathogens on the outside of the meat as well as internally.You may want to avoid any undercooked meat, including those deliberately left raw, such as sushi, sashimi, and lox.Raw egg Raw eggs, including cooked eggs with runny yolks, are notorious for possibly carrying Salmonella bacteria, but products containing raw eggs can be challenging to spot.Items that may contain raw egg include:smoothieshomemade eggnoghomemade mayonnaiseuncooked cookie doughhollandaise sauceCaesar salad dressingRaw nuts or fresh nut buttersRaw nuts may seem safe because of their low moisture content and long shelf life, but certain pathogens such as Salmonella don’t need much moisture to thrive.Avoiding raw nuts and their products, such as fresh nut butters, can help lower your risk of a foodborne illness in the same way as it does for raw vegetables.The Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention notes that long storage times for nut products may also increase the risk of illness related to fungi growth.Cream-filled baked goodsBaked goods that contain cream fillings often have a milk base, which can be an ideal medium in which foodborne pathogens may grow.Raw honey or honeycombThe use of raw honey during cancer treatment is controversial.Some evidence suggests honey may have a variety of anticancer properties, but at the same time, it can potentially carry dangerous pathogens such as those that may cause botulism.Certain waterUsing water directly from wells, springs, or streams may expose you to microorganisms and pathogens that cause illness, such as:Escherichia coli (E. coli)CryptosporidiumLegionellaFoods to boost your immune system during chemotherapyWith the rules of washing, cooking, and sourcing in mind, there are plenty of helpful foods to eat during chemotherapy.According to Ruz Gatica, some foods may even boost your immunity.“There are certain foods that can support the body’s immune function during chemotherapy. Foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E, selenium, and zinc are particularly beneficial for the immune system,” she said.Vitamin-rich sources can be found in foods such as:sweet potatoesbroccolisquashpumpkin seedslentilssalmoneggsRemember, it’s not that you can’t eat eggs or vegetables while undergoing chemotherapy. As long as they’re properly prepared, they can be a part of maintaining overall health.Ruz Gatica suggested, “If symptoms like poor appetite occur while undergoing chemotherapy, consuming these immune-supportive foods as small, frequent meals can help meet energy needs without exacerbating symptoms.”Why is diet important in chemotherapy?Diet management during chemotherapy is important as a means of warding off infection, but it’s also how you can keep your body as healthy as possible to aid in cancer treatment and minimize the side effects of chemotherapy.“When it comes to going through chemotherapy, what’s on your plate really matters,” indicated Ruz Gatica. “Eating the right foods helps keep your body’s engine running smoothly, supporting metabolic and functional health while warding off any chance of malnutrition.”She added that by ensuring you get enough protein, calories, vitamins, and minerals, you’re helping your body stay strong and resilient throughout treatment.TakeawayFoods to avoid while on chemotherapy are those that may increase your chances of food-related illness.While anyone can become sick from eating a contaminated product, chemotherapy knocks your immune system down and can make you more vulnerable to infections.Focusing on thoroughly cooked foods and washed produce, as well as skipping bin-style and deli cooler items, are simple rules that can help you eat the right foods during cancer treatment. How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Cox/Getty ImagesESPNJul 14, 2025, 11:20 PM ETEmailPrintOpen Extended ReactionsCal Raleigh is your 2025 MLB All-Star Home Run Derby champion!The Seattle Mariners slugger not only takes home his first Derby title in his first appearance after outlasting Tampa Bay Rays star Junior Caminero, but he becomes the first catcher to win the event.It was a power-packed night in Atlanta as Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Oneil Cruz hit a ball a whopping 513 feet for the longest blast of the night before being eliminated in the semifinal. Hometown star Matt Olson of the Atlanta Braves was eliminated in the first round despite starting his outing off hot, while New York Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. hit just three shots in his first-round exit. Athletics DH Brent Rooker and Washington Nationals left fielder were the other two knocked out early, paving the way for Raleigh, Caminero, Cruz and Minnesota Twins center fielder Byron Buxton to take center stage at Truist Park.We have your one-stop shop for everything Derby related, from the round-by-round results to our favorite moments from one of the most anticipated events of the summer.Takeaways from the Home Run DerbyJorge Castillo: The Home Run Derby's tiebreaker rule for the first round needs an overhaul. Rooker said he thought he was headed for a swing-off against Raleigh to determine who advanced to the semifinals once he saw Raleigh had tied him with 17 home runs and a longest distance of 471 feet. He even got loose to prepare for one.Then Raleigh told Rooker he was eliminated because Raleigh had hit his longest home run at 470.61 feet as compared to Rooker's 470.53, per Statcast. That difference, Rooker noted, was not displayed for the contestants to see and adjust accordingly. A disparity that slim should fall within a margin for error (are we sure Statcast is that accurate?) and warrant a swing-off, which is the tiebreaker used for the semifinals and the final. The Derby almost always steers clear of any controversy; this year was a bit different.Editor's Picks'It's something that's never been done': Why the 'Big Dumper's' Derby win was only the beginning4hJeff PassanOlney: Breaking down the Derby contestants -- and their pitchers17hBuster OlneyShocks at No. 1 -- and No. 2?! Winners, losers and takeaways from MLB draft Day 11dAlden Gonzalez, +2 More2 RelatedJesse Rogers: Raleigh, the \"Big Dumper,\" was great, as expected. But this might have been a welcome-to-the-big-stage moment for Caminero. He looked effortless at the plate in his first Derby appearance, blasting home runs over the short wall in left field. The night began with Cruz hitting a 513-foot home run and ended with a battle between Caminero and the eventual winner. While Raleigh and Cruz might garner more headlines for their exploits -- as will Chisholm for hitting just three homers in his first-round exit -- it is Caminero who might have been the most impressive considering his age, as at 22 he would have made history as the youngest Derby winner. Caminero will win this event soon enough.David Schoenfield: It's been a miracle first half for Raleigh with 38 home runs, and he showed why he's on pace for 64 homers on the season with an impressive display of raw power and exquisite timing on Monday night. With his dad pitching and his younger brother catching, it also will go down as one of the more memorable winning performances. Next up: battling Aaron Judge for MVP honors and leading the Mariners to their first American League West title since 2001 -- and maybe the first World Series appearance in franchise history. Dream big, Mariners fans, just like 8-year-old Cal Raleigh.MLB Home Run Derby resultsFinal\nCal Raleigh (18) vs. Junior Caminero (15)Semifinal\n3. Byron Buxton (7) vs. 2. Junior Caminero (8)\n4. Cal Raleigh (19) vs. 1. Oneil Cruz (13)First round\n1. James Wood: 16 home runs (eliminated)\n2. Brent Rooker: 17 home runs (eliminated)\n3. Junior Caminero: 21 home runs\n4. Oneil Cruz: 21 home runs\n5. Byron Buxton: 20 home runs\n6. Jazz Chisholm Jr.: 3 home runs (eliminated)\n7. Cal Raleigh: 17 home runs\n8. Matt Olson: 15 home runs (eliminated)Updates and analysis from the Derby\nOur pre-Derby predictionsWho is going to win the Derby and who will be the runner-up?Jeff Passan: Raleigh. His swing is perfect for the Derby: He leads MLB this season in both pull percentage and fly ball percentage, so it's not as if he needs to recalibrate it to succeed. He has also become a prolific hitter from the right side this season -- 16 home runs in 102 at-bats -- and his ability to switch between right- and left-handed pitching offers a potential advantage. No switch-hitter (or catcher for that matter) has won a Home Run Derby. The Big Dumper is primed to be the first, beating Buxton in the finals.Alden Gonzalez: Cruz. He might be wildly inconsistent at this point in his career, but he is perfect for the Derby -- young enough to possess the stamina required for a taxing event that could become exhausting in the Atlanta heat; left-handed, in a ballpark where the ball carries out better to right field; and, most importantly, capable of hitting balls at incomprehensible velocities. Raleigh will put on a good show from both sides of the plate but will come in second.Buster Olney: Olson. He is effectively pinch-hitting for Acuna, and because he received word in the past 72 hours of his participation, he hasn't had the practice rounds that the other competitors have been going through. But he's the only person in this group who has done the Derby before, which means he has experienced the accelerated pace, adrenaline and push of the crowd.His pitcher, Eddie Perez, knows something about performing in a full stadium in Atlanta. And, as Olson acknowledged in a conversation Sunday, the park generally favors left-handed hitters because of the larger distances that right-handed hitters must cover in left field.The most obscure MLB All-Stars everFrom World War II fill-ins and a shortstop with a 37 OPS+ to this year's Rockies rep.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nJesse Rogers: Olson. Home-field advantage will mean something this year as hitting in 90-plus degree heat and humidity will be an extra challenge in Atlanta. Olson understands that and can pace himself accordingly. Plus, he was a late addition. He has got nothing to lose. He'll outlast the young bucks in the field. And I'm not putting Raleigh any lower than second -- his first half screams that he'll be in the finals against Olson.Jorge Castillo: Wood. His mammoth power isn't disputed -- he can jack baseballs to all fields. But the slight defect in his power package is that he doesn't hit the ball in the air nearly as often as a typical slugger. Wood ranks 126th out of 155 qualified hitters across the majors in fly ball percentage. And he still has swatted 24 home runs this season. So, in an event where he's going to do everything he can to lift baseballs, hitting fly balls won't be an issue, and Wood is going to show off that gigantic power en route to a victory over Cruz in the finals.Who will hit the longest home run of the night -- and how far?Passan: Cruz hits the ball harder than anyone in baseball history. He's the choice here, at 493 feet.Gonzalez: If you exclude the Coors Field version, there have been just six Statcast-era Derby home runs that have traveled 497-plus feet. They were compiled by two men: Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton. James Wood -- all 6-foot-7, 234 pounds of him -- will become the third.Olney: James Wood has the easy Stanton- and Judge-type power, and he will clear the Chophouse with the longest homer. Let's say 497 feet.Rogers: Hopefully he doesn't injure himself doing it, but Buxton will break out his massive strength and crush a ball at least 505 feet. I don't see him advancing far in the event, but for one swing, he'll own the night.Castillo: Cruz hits baseballs hard and far. He'll crush a few bombs, and one will reach an even 500 feet.Who is the one slugger fans will know much better after the Derby?One trade every MLB team should makeFrom a Cy Young winner to an All-Star closer, here's one player every MLB team should trade for (or away) this July.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nPassan: Buxton capped his first half with a cycle on Saturday, and he'll carry that into the Derby, where he will remind the world why he was baseball's No. 1 prospect in 2015. Buxton's talent has never been in question, just his health. And with his body feeling right, he has the opportunity to put on a show fans won't soon forget.Olney: Caminero isn't a big name and wasn't a high-end prospect like Wood was earlier in his career. Just 3½ years ago, Caminero was dealt to the Rays by the Cleveland Guardians in a relatively minor November trade for pitcher Tobias Myers. But since then, he has refined his ability to cover inside pitches and is blossoming this year into a player with ridiculous power. He won't win the Derby, but he'll open some eyes.What's the one moment we'll all be talking about long after this Derby ends?Gonzalez: The incredible distances and velocities that will be reached, particularly by Wood, Cruz, Caminero, Raleigh and Buxton. The hot, humid weather at Truist Park will only aid the mind-blowing power that will be on display Monday night.Rogers: The exhaustion on the hitter's faces, swinging for home run after home run in the heat and humidity of Hot-lanta!Castillo: Cruz's 500-foot blast and a bunch of other lasers he hits in the first two rounds before running out of gas in the finals.\nTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads© ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

We round up the main talking points...\nMonday 14 July 2025 15:17, UK\nSerious business for competing clubs\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nCole Palmer and Reece James give their thoughts on US President Donald Trump joining the Chelsea squad for the Club World Cup trophy lift\nIt was clear right from the start of the tournament that the clubs involved were taking the competition seriously. Despite European cynicism in the build-up - and during, courtesy of Jurgen Klopp - it turned out to be more than an end-of-season inconvenience.\nThe big European teams generally fielded their strongest possible line-ups and there was a rush to recruit new signings in time for the tournament, with FIFA eager to point out that 59 new players were registered by participating clubs in the early June transfer window, at a total cost of $480 million (£356m).\nWinners Chelsea hit the jackpot\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol explains how Chelsea won the Club World Cup and how Donald Trump, Robbie Williams and Coldplay were also centre stage\nIt helped, of course, that the financial rewards on offer were so lucrative. Chelsea are estimated to have earned £85m by winning the competition, according to Sky Sports News, with runners-up Paris Saint-Germain banking £78.4m.In total, FIFA's prize pot shared between 32 competing clubs was £774m ($1bn). Every club received a participation fee of up to £28m depending on their confederation, ensuring that even those knocked out at the group stage left better off. Manchester City made £38m despite being eliminated in the round of 16.\nUltimately, money talks. In an age of financial fair play and PSR, the financial rewards on offer won out over player welfare and fatigue concerns. Four years from now, you can be sure that club owners and executives from across the footballing world will be eager for a slice of the pie when the competition returns.\nLow crowds provide talking pointLow attendances became a source of embarrassment to FIFA in the early stages of the tournament, particularly when Chelsea played their opening game against LAFC in front of just 22,137 fans at the 71,000-capacity Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\nAlso See:\nStream Sky Sports on NOW\nDownload the Sky Sports App\nGet Sky Sports on WhatsApp!\nLive football on Sky Sports this week\nImage:\nThe Mercedes-Benz Stadium was less than a third full for Chelsea's opening game\nThere were many more fixtures played out in sparsely-attended stadia, with four matches failing to even draw crowds of 10,000. Others, though, were more popular, with 16 games, including Sunday's sold-out final, attracting at least 60,000 fans.FIFA pointed to kick-off times, ticket prices and weather (more on that later) as factors in the low attendances but the numbers did pick up as the tournament progressed, with over two and a half million tickets sold in total and an average attendance of 39,705, the increases partly down to dynamic pricing which allowed fans to gain entry to some games for as little as £8.\nImage:\nWydad Casablanca fans pack out a stand in their group-stage game against Man City\nWhile far from spectacular for a 63-game tournament, the overall numbers were enough for FIFA to trumpet the competition's appeal in its expanded format. There seems little doubt it is here to stay.Weather delays a cause for concernSweltering heat was an issue throughout the tournament. As temperatures soared, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said it was \"impossible\" to have a normal training session while midfielder Enzo Fernandez said it was \"very dangerous\" to play in the conditions.Fernandez also argued, with some justification, that the spectacle was affected. \"The speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow,\" he added.\nImage:\nChelsea's round of 16 game against Benfica in Charlotte was suspended for two hours\nThe extreme weather caused farcical scenes as a string of matches had to be delayed and suspended, including Chelsea's round of 16 win over Benfica, which featured a two-hour hiatus, when players and fans were told to seek shelter because of lightning in the area.The weather issues were of course particularly concerning given the US is hosting next year's World Cup, along with Mexico and Canada. FIFA president Gianni Infantino sought to downplay those worries by saying games with daytime kick-offs designed European audiences will take place in covered stadia.Brazilian clubs seize chance to impressChelsea and Paris Saint-Germain ensured the final was a European affair but some representatives from the rest of the world made a mark too. Saudi outfit Al Hilal held Real Madrid and beat Manchester City. Collectively, the Brazilian clubs were the most impressive.All four of Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and Fluminense made it to the knockout stages, with the latter two reaching the quarter-finals and semis respectively. Three of the four enjoyed memorable wins over prestigious European opponents along the way.\nImage:\nPalmeiras reached the quarter-finals\nImage:\nFlamengo beat Chelsea 3-1 in the group stage\nBotafogo were the one of only two teams, along with Chelsea, to beat Paris Saint-Germain with their 1-0 group-stage victory, while Flamengo secured a 3-1 win over the eventual champions and Fluminense saw off Inter 2-0 in the round of 16.Their performances, cheered on by large and colourful contingents of travelling fans, highlighted the quality of their league and provided a source of pride to a Brazilian public whose domestic stars rarely get an opportunity to shine on a global stage.Trump, a half-time show and player 'walk-ons'\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nHighlights of the FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain\nIt is fair to say the 'Americanisation' of certain aspects of the tournament was met with mixed reviews. The final had the look and feel of the Superbowl, with lengthy pre-match and half-time shows. There was even a fighter-jet fly-past.US president Donald Trump was eager to place himself front and centre in Sunday's final, watching on with Infantino at the MetLife Stadium and later gatecrashing Chelsea's celebrations, to the bemusement of match-winner Cole Palmer.\nThroughout the tournament, there were also WWE-style 'walk-ons', which involved all 22 starters in every game being individually announced over the loudspeaker instead of emerging from the tunnel together in the traditional way.Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia was a fan, saying: \"It's a bit of a showbiz thing, isn't it?\" and adding that he would like to see it in the Premier League. But others felt differently, with the lengthy process frustrating many fans at home and delaying kick-offs.Will fatigue come back to bite Man City, Chelsea and others?Their finances look healthy following the tournament. Chelsea fans will relish holding the title of world champions for four years. But will competing clubs' performances suffer next season as a result of the extra Club World Cup workload?\"I try not to think about it, otherwise I will be so anxious,\" said Pep Guardiola last month. Manchester City's round of 16 exit against Al-Hilal was their 61st game of the season in all competitions.\"Maybe in November, December, January, ask me,\" added Guardiola. \"I may say 'So listen, we are a disaster. We are exhausted. The World Cup destroyed us.'\"It is a worry for Chelsea too, given they played even more games than Manchester City at 64.With the Premier League kick-off only a month away, they will be desperately hoping England boss Thomas Tuchel, who predicted the tournament will give Liverpool and Arsenal a \"huge\" advantage next term, is not proved right. But the true ramifications might only become clear later in the campaign.\nACCAFREEZE WITH SKY BET\nAccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!\nAround Sky\nOther Sports\nUpgrade to Sky Sports\nOther Sports\nNot got Sky?

The more experienced ≈öwiƒÖtek did not lose a single game en route to a straight sets victory over a rattled Anisimova, who struggled in her first grand slam final.\n‚Ä¢ Historic performance: ≈öwiƒÖtek is the first Polish Wimbledon singles champion ‚Äî men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs ‚Äî in the Open Era. It‚Äôs also the first time in that era that a women‚Äôs player has won the title without giving up a game.\n‚Ä¢ Emotional remarks: A jubilant ≈öwiƒÖtek, who had struggled on grass courts prior to this tournament, said after the match that she could hardly process the victory. Anisimova, who has been open about mental health struggles and took a break from the sport in 2023, lauded her opponent and thanked her support system in tearful on-court remarks.\nAll\nCatch Up\n46 Posts\nWe‚Äôve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. Read more about the match here.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek dominates on difficult day for American Amanda Anisimova\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates after winning her first Wimbledon title.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nAfter two weeks of exceptional tennis from both Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek and Amanda Anisimova, today‚Äôs women‚Äôs singles final was over before it even really began.\nIt took just 57 minutes for ≈öwiƒÖtek to dispatch her American opponent. The world No. 4 did not drop a single game on her way to lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish.\nAnisimova ‚Äî who has one of the best returns on the WTA Tour ‚Äî had no reply for the Polish star‚Äôs dominance when serving. The American forced deuce once in the second set but failed to muster a single break point throughout.\nBut it was on her own serve that the 23-year-old really lost the match. She won just 26% of her first-serve points and double-faulted five times. Alongside that, she committed 28 unforced errors.\nAt times, it was a difficult watch at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. It was easy to tell which player had experience in grand slam finals. ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs poise contrasted starkly with Anisimova‚Äôs increasing frustration.\nAmanda Anisimova appears dejected during the second set Saturday.\nHannah Peters/Getty Images\nDuring the second set, the American had opportunities to win her first game but ended up letting out a scream when that chance eluded her again.\nFor its part, the crowd at Centre Court got behind the struggling world No. 12, both during the match and afterward when she gave an emotional on-court interview.\nAnisimova‚Äôs fellow American tennis star Coco Gauff was also quick to offer her support, writing in a post on X: ‚Äúkeep your head up.‚Äù\nso much to be proud of Amanda‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è keep your head up üëë— Coco Gauff (@CocoGauff) July 12, 2025\nBut it was ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs day. The 24-year-old displayed her impressive forehand once again to round out a tournament in which she has far outperformed her previous self ‚Äî she had only made it as far as the quarterfinals before this year.\nThe world No. 4 hit three aces, won 72% of her first-serve points and converted 67% of her break points. But, in truth, it was her ability to stay in rallies and wait for Anisimova‚Äôs errors that proved most decisive.\n≈öwiƒÖtek now has a Wimbledon title to add to her 2022 US Open win, and the four she has claimed at Roland Garros. The feat sees her become the eighth woman in the Open Era to win grand slam singles titles on all three surfaces, according to Opta.\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates a point.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nLink Copied!\nIn pictures: ≈öwiƒÖtek makes Wimbledon history\nFrom CNN's Digital Photo Desk\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates after winning her first Wimbledon title.\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek overwhelmed Amanda Anisimova on Saturday to win her first Wimbledon title and her sixth grand slam overall.\nThe 6-0, 6-0 scoreline hasn‚Äôt happened in a women‚Äôs Wimbledon singles final since 1911. It‚Äôs also the second time it‚Äôs ever happened in any grand slam since Steffi Graf did it in 1988.\n≈öwiƒÖtek is the first Polish player ‚Äî man or woman ‚Äî to ever win the Wimbledon singles title. She broke Anisimova‚Äôs serve in the very first game and never looked back.\nIt was the first grand slam final for Anisimova, and it will be one the American wants to forget. Her frustration was evident throughout the match. But her talent is clear from the two weeks she‚Äôs spent at the tournament, and it likely won‚Äôt be the last we see of her.\nSee more photos from Saturday‚Äôs final:\nAmanda Anisimova reacts after a point.\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\n≈öwiƒÖtek was in superb form Saturday. She now has won a Wimbledon title, a US Open title and four French Open titles.\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\nAnisimova serves to ≈öwiƒÖtek on Centre Court.

No matter what happened today, you should be proud of the work you‚Äôre doing, and I hope we‚Äôre gonna play in many more finals here and other tournaments ‚Äî you have the game for that, so congrats to your team as well.\n‚ÄúHonestly, I didn‚Äôt even dream because, for me, it was just way too far.\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek, 2025 Wimbledon women's singles champion\n‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm already an experienced player after winning the slams before, but I never really expected this one, so I want to thank my team because I feel like they believed in me more than I did.‚Äù\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs victory was historic ‚Äî and not just for Wimbledon\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates with the Venus Rosewater Dish.\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\nToday marks not only the first time in the Open Era ‚Äî and first time since 1911 ‚Äî that a player has won a women‚Äôs singles final at the All England Lawn Tennis Club without dropping a game.\nIt is also just the second time ever in the modern era, which began in 1968, that a grand slam singles final has been won in such a manner, after Steffi Graf beat Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 at Roland Garros in 1988, according to Opta.\nThe consolation for Anisimova is that Zvereva would go on to finish her career having been the world No. 1 and winning four singles titles and 20 grand slam doubles and mixed doubles titles.\nToday is ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs day, but we‚Äôll be hearing from Anisimova again.\nLink Copied!\n\"Thank you, Iga,\" Anisimova shows humor in defeat\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova speaks to the crowd after the match.\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\nA tearful Anisimova steps up for her post-match interview with the crowd cheering her on.\nAfter taking some time to compose herself, the American jokingly thanked her opponent for the thrashing on Centre Court today.\n‚ÄúThank you, Iga,‚Äù she said, before praising the Polish star.\nThe 23-year-old also said she would never forget her Wimbledon experience this year, adding she simply ‚Äúran out of gas.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI wish that I could put on a better performance for all of you. You guys have still been there for me and lifted me up today, so thank you so much,‚Äù she said.\nAnisimova then thanked her mom and burst into tears when her mom‚Äôs face appeared on the big screens inside the court.\n‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be standing here if you guys didn‚Äôt fly in and support me throughout the rest of the tournament,‚Äù she said to her friends and family.\n‚ÄúYou guys were my extra motivation and inspiration that I needed. My mom, who flew in this morning, I definitely would not be standing here.‚Äù\nA very emotional end to what has been a brilliant tournament for the American.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova walked off court briefly but is back for presentation\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova reacts after her loss.\nToby Melville/Reuters\nWhile ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrated the win, Anisimova walked off the court, maybe just to collect her thoughts.\nIt‚Äôs commonplace for the runner-up to give a post-match interview on court, but you could forgive organizers for breaking that tradition today.\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek drops to the floor in celebration\nFrom CNN's Ben Church\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek falls to the ground after winning the title.\nHannah Peters/Getty Images\nConsidering how poorly Anisimova performed in that match, it‚Äôs easy to forget how well Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek played.\nThe Polish star has created history for herself and you can see how much it meant to her after that match point whistled past the American.\nThe 24-year-old fell to her back on the grass, before she picked herself up and gave her opponent a massive hug.\nThe new Wimbledon champion then ran through the crowd to her player‚Äôs box where she celebrated with her team.\nReal emotion from a true champion.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek wins her first Wimbledon singles title in historic fashion\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates after winning match point.\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek has been crowned the women‚Äôs singles champion at Wimbledon for the first time with an unprecedented 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova.\nIt is the first time in the Open Era that a women‚Äôs player has won the final without giving up a game, and the first time overall since 1911.\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek moves closer to maiden Wimbledon title\nFrom CNN's Thomas Schlachter\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek is nearing her sixth grand slam title.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nBlink and you‚Äôll miss it.\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek is now just one game away from winning her first grand slam at Wimbledon.\nThe Polish sensation has bulldozed her way to a 5-0 lead in the second set and is making light work of her first final in SW19.\nAnisimova will be hoping to at least get one game on the board before this final ends.\nLink Copied!\nNoise is deafening every time Anisimova wins a point\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nThis has become less about who wins Wimbledon, and more can the American win a game.\nIt doesn‚Äôt look great for her at the moment, though.\nThe crowd really is pushing her on and going crazy whenever she wins a point and gets the better of a rally.\nProblem is, those moments are very few and far between.\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek up 4-0 again after Anisimova forces deuce\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nAmanda Anisimova reacts after a point.\nHannah Peters/Getty Images\nWe see the best showing so far from the American who forces deuce before losing a long rally.\n≈öwiƒÖtek double faults to take it back to deuce, but aces and then has too much again for her opponent on the following point.\nIt‚Äôs nothing more than small consolation for Anisimova.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova's serve letting her down\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova serves to Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek during Saturday's final.\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\nIt‚Äôs going from bad to worse for Anisimova in this match and it‚Äôs her serve letting her down the most.\nThe American has managed to get just 41% of her first serves in, producing four double faults in the process.\nIt‚Äôs form that simply isn‚Äôt good enough for any tennis match at this level, nevermind the Wimbledon final and you can see she knows it.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova looks dejected as ≈öwiƒÖtek breaks yet again\nFrom CNN's Thomas Schlachter\nIt has been a nightmare final so far for Amanda Anisimova.\nToby Melville/Reuters\nThis would not have been how Amanda Anisimova envisaged her first grand slam final going.\nThe American is still yet to win a single game in the matchup and now faces a 3-0 deficit and an uphill climb in the second set.\nThe crowd is starting to will the 23-year-old towards her first game of the match, but their efforts are in vain as things stand.\nWhile Anisimova has struggled with her serve, ≈öwiƒÖtek has been at her very best to punish her opponent and is dominating with her strong return game.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek is having fun out there\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek has been in top form so far in the Wimbledon final.\nToby Melville/Reuters\nIt‚Äôs hard not to feel sorry for Anisimova given how this match is going, but her opponent is looking so assured right now.\n≈öwiƒÖtek has historically struggled on grass, but is dominating here ‚Äì her serve reaches 117 mph on the way to another hold. She‚Äôs made to work for this one a bit more, with Anisimova tying the score at 30-30 before the Pole takes control again.\nLink Copied!\nScreams of frustration from Anisimova\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova is still looking to win her first game.\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\nThis is actually getting quite hard to watch now.\nAnisimova had chances to win her first service game there but produced two unforced errors when it really mattered.\nShe let out two screams during that game, the loudest when her opponent took yet another break point opportunity to take the lead again in this second set.\nLink Copied!\nMore of the same as Anisimova‚Äôs struggles continue\nFrom CNN's Thomas Schlachter\nAmanda Anisimova stretches for a forehand shot.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nAfter losing the opening set 6-0, Anisimova would have been hoping to get on the board as early as possible in the second.\nIt wasn‚Äôt to be, however, for the American who dropped yet another service game.\n≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs dominance when attacking Anisimova‚Äôs second serve is proving vital as she gets yet another break to fall her way.\nThis could be over very quickly.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs \"bakery\" open for business, even in the Wimbledon final\nFrom CNN's George Ramsay\nIt was a dominant opening set from ≈öwiƒÖtek, but this is nothing new for the Polish star.\nShe is unmatched in her ability to sweep aside opponents in brutal fashion, and her habit of winning sets 6-0 ‚Äî referred to as a ‚Äúbagel‚Äù ‚Äî and 6-1 ‚Äî a ‚Äúbreadstick‚Äù ‚Äî has led to jokes from tennis fans about ≈öwiƒÖtek running a bakery.\nAnisimova will be hoping ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs bakery closes early today.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova looks deflated after first set thrashing\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova has yet to find her footing in her first grand slam final.\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\nYou‚Äôve really got to feel for Anisimova here.\nShe hasn‚Äôt even completed 30 minutes of her first grand slam final and she‚Äôs already one set down.\nThe American walks over to her chair and wraps an ice towel around her neck, while rubbing an ice pack on her face.\nShe‚Äôs certainly feeling the heat in more ways than one here.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek takes the first set in double quick time\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek serves to Amanda Anisimova.\nKin Cheung/AP\nWe‚Äôve barely even gotten going on Centre Court, and already ≈öwiƒÖtek has claimed the first set.\nAnisimova is having to endure a nightmare start, and this game is no better. She fails to return ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs first two serves, before losing the next point after an excellent rally. ≈öwiƒÖtek then seals the deal to take the game to 0.\nIf Anisimova is going to get anything from this, she‚Äôs going to have to come out for the second set playing completely differently.\nLink Copied!\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics you follow\nSign out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nLive TV\nListen\nWatch\nWorld\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nChina\nEurope\nIndia\nMiddle East\nUnited Kingdom\nUS Politics\nTrump\nFacts First\nCNN Polls\n2025 Elections\nBusiness\nTech\nMedia\nCalculators\nVideos\nMarkets\nPre-markets\nAfter-Hours\nFear & Greed\nInvesting\nMarkets Now\nNightcap\nHealth\nLife, But Better\nFitness\nFood\nSleep\nMindfulness\nRelationships\nEntertainment\nMovies\nTelevision\nCelebrity\nTech\nInnovate\nForeseeable Future\nMission: Ahead\nWork Transformed\nInnovative Cities\nStyle\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nBeauty\nVideo\nTravel\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nStay\nNews\nVideos\nSports\nFootball\nTennis\nGolf\nMotorsport\nUS Sports\nOlympics\nClimbing\nEsports\nHockey\nScience\nSpace\nLife\nUnearthed\nClimate\nSolutions\nWeather\nWeather\nVideo\nClimate\nUkraine-Russia War\nIsrael-Hamas War\nFeatures\nAs Equals\nCall to Earth\nFreedom Project\nImpact Your World\nInside Africa\nCNN Heroes\nWatch\nLive TV\nCNN Fast\nShows A-Z\nCNN10\nCNN Max\nCNN TV Schedules\nListen\nCNN 5 Things\nChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\nThe Assignment with Audie Cornish\nOne Thing\nTug of War\nCNN Political Briefing\nThe Axe Files\nAll There Is with Anderson Cooper\nAll CNN Audio podcasts\nGames\nDaily Crossword\nJumble Crossword\nSudoblock\nSudoku\n5 Things Quiz\nAbout CNN\nPhotos\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\nSports\nWatch\nListen\nLive TV\nFollow CNN\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics you follow\nSign out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nAccessibility & CC\nAbout\nNewsletters\nTranscripts\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Unlike traditional clustering methods like K-Means, it doesn’t require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. Instead, it identifies the optimal number of clusters automatically based on the data. In this article, we’ll see the mathematical implementation of Affinity Propagation and its core concepts.Key Parameters Influencing ClusteringTo understand the math behind Affinity Propagation, we need to understand the two key parameters that influence the clustering process:1. PreferenceIt controls the number of exemplars (cluster centers) chosen by the algorithm.Higher preferences lead to more exemplars resulting in more clusters.2. Damping FactorThe damping factor helps stabilize the algorithm by limiting how much each update can change between iterations.Without damping, the algorithm can oscillate or keep bouncing between values helps in making it difficult to converge to a final solution.These two parameters play an important role in finding the stability and effectiveness of the algorithm as it iterates through its processes.Mathematical FormulationThe core idea behind Affinity Propagation is based on two matrices: responsibility and availability. The algorithm iteratively updates these matrices to find the best exemplars (centroids) representing the data.Similarity Matrix (Starting Point)We start with a similarity matrix S where S(i, j) represents the similarity between two points x_i​ and x_j​. The similarity is calculated as the negative squared Euclidean distance:S(i, j) = -\\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert^2The diagonal elements of this matrix, S(i, i), represent the preference for each point to become an exemplar.Responsibility The responsibility matrix R is updated to reflect how well-suited point x_k​ is to serve as the exemplar for point x_i​, relative to other candidate exemplars:This is calculated as:r(i, k) \\leftarrow s(i, k) - \\max \\left\\{ a(i, k') + s(i, k') \\right\\}_{k' \\neq k}\nHere r(i,k) represents the responsibility of point x_k​ for being the exemplar of point x_i​ considering all other points k'.Availability The availability matrix A is updated to represent how appropriate it would be for point x_i​ to choose point x_k​ as its exemplar, considering the preferences of other points. This is calculated as:a(i, k) \\leftarrow \\min \\left( 0, r(k, k) + \\sum_{i' \\neq k} \\max \\left( 0, r(i', k) \\right) \\right) \\quad \\text{for} \\, i \\neq k \\,Where i is not eaul to k, and:a(k, k) \\leftarrow \\sum_{i' \\neq k} \\max \\left( 0, r(i', k) \\right)ConvergenceThese responsibility and availability matrices are updated iteratively until convergence at which point the algorithm selects the exemplars. The final step is to identify the points where the sum of responsibility and availability is positive:r(i, i) + a(i, i) > 0 Points that meet this condition are considered the exemplars and clusters are formed based on these exemplars.Visualizing the ProcessIn Affinity Propagation, messages are passed between data points in two main steps:Responsibility Messages (Left Side): These messages shows how each data point communicates with its candidate exemplars. Each point sends responsibility messages to suggest how suitable it is to be chosen as an exemplar.Availability Messages (Right Side): These messages reflect how appropriate it is for each data point to choose its corresponding exemplar considering the support from other points. Essentially, these messages show how much support the candidate exemplars have.The diagram above shows how the responsibility messages are passed on the left and the availability messages are passed on the right. This iterative message-passing process helps find the final exemplars for clustering.Python Implementation with Scikit-LearnHere we will be generating synthetic dataset for its implementation.Also we are using Sckit-Learn, Matplotlib and other libraries.AffinityPropagation(preference = -50): Initializes the algorithm with a preference value of -50 which influences the number of exemplars (cluster centers) generated by the algorithm.n_clusters_: Number of clusters is calculated by counting the exemplars identified by the algorithm.cluster_centers_indices_: Retrieves the indices of the data points that serve as cluster centers (exemplars).\nPython\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom itertools import cycle\ncenters = [[1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, -1], [-1, -1]]\nX, labels_true = make_blobs(n_samples = 400, centers = centers,\ncluster_std = 0.5, random_state = 0)\naf = AffinityPropagation(preference =-50).fit(X)\ncluster_centers_indices = af.cluster_centers_indices_\nlabels = af.labels_\nn_clusters_ = len(cluster_centers_indices)\nplt.close('all')\nplt.figure(1)\nplt.clf()\ncolors = cycle('bgrcmykbgrcmykbgrcmykbgrcmyk')\nfor k, col in zip(range(n_clusters_), colors):\nclass_members = labels == k\ncluster_center = X[cluster_centers_indices[k]]\nplt.plot(X[class_members, 0], X[class_members, 1], col + '.')\nplt.plot(cluster_center[0], cluster_center[1], 'o',\nmarkerfacecolor = col, markeredgecolor ='k',\nmarkersize = 14)\nfor x in X[class_members]:\nplt.plot([cluster_center[0], x[0]],\n[cluster_center[1], x[1]], col)\nplt.title('Estimated number of clusters: % d' % n_clusters_)\nplt.show()\nOutput:Clustering and visualization.The algorithm automatically detects 3 clusters without needing to pre-define the number of clusters.Advantages of Affinity PropagationNo need to pre-define clusters: The algorithm automatically finds the number of clusters based on the data.Handles varying cluster sizes and shapes: Unlike K-Means, it can identify clusters of different sizes and densities.Exemplars as cluster centers: Data points themselves serve as exemplars (cluster centers) helps in making the results more interpretable.Suitable for complex datasets: Performs well on datasets where traditional clustering methods like K-Means might struggle.Limitations of Affinity PropagationComputationally expensive: The algorithm can be slow for large datasets due to iterative updates of matrices.Sensitive to parameters: The preference and damping factor values significantly impact the results and may require tuning.Memory usage: The need to store and update large similarity matrices can be memory-intensive.Convergence issues: The algorithm may not converge properly if the damping factor is not tuned correctly.By mastering Affinity Propagation, one can effectively identify clusters in complex datasets without the need to predefine the number of clusters while also gaining insights into parameter tuning and computational considerations for optimal performance.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nTop 15 Machine Learning Algorithms Every Data Scientist Should Know in 2025\nD\nDebomit Dey\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nML-Clustering\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learning\nSimilar Reads\nMachine Learning Algorithms  Machine learning algorithms are essentially sets of instructions that allow computers to learn from data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

Each of these models may not be very strong on its own, but when we put their results together, we get a better and more accurate answer. It's like asking a group of people for advice instead of just one person—each one might be a little wrong, but together, they usually give a better answer.Types of Ensembles Learning in Machine LearningThere are three main types of ensemble methods:Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):Models are trained independently on different random subsets of the training data. Their results are then combined—usually by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification). This helps reduce variance and prevents overfitting.Boosting:Models are trained one after another. Each new model focuses on fixing the errors made by the previous ones. The final prediction is a weighted combination of all models, which helps reduce bias and improve accuracy.Stacking (Stacked Generalization):Multiple different models (often of different types) are trained, and their predictions are used as inputs to a final model, called a meta-model. The meta-model learns how to best combine the predictions of the base models, aiming for better performance than any individual model.1. Bagging AlgorithmBagging classifier can be used for both regression and classification tasks. Here is an overview of Bagging classifier algorithm:Bootstrap Sampling: Divides the original training data into ‘N’ subsets and randomly selects a subset with replacement in some rows from other subsets. This step ensures that the base models are trained on diverse subsets of the data and there is no class imbalance.Base Model Training: For each bootstrapped sample we train a base model independently on that subset of data. These weak models are trained in parallel to increase computational efficiency and reduce time consumption. We can use different base learners i.e. different ML models as base learners to bring variety and robustness.Prediction Aggregation: To make a prediction on testing data combine the predictions of all base models. For classification tasks it can include majority voting or weighted majority while for regression it involves averaging the predictions.Out-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation: Some samples are excluded from the training subset of particular base models during the bootstrapping method. These “out-of-bag” samples can be used to estimate the model’s performance without the need for cross-validation.Final Prediction: After aggregating the predictions from all the base models, Bagging produces a final prediction for each instance.Python pseudo code for Bagging Estimator implementing libraries:1. Importing Libraries and Loading DataBaggingClassifier: for creating an ensemble of classifiers trained on different subsets of data.DecisionTreeClassifier: the base classifier used in the bagging ensemble.load_iris: to load the Iris dataset for classification.train_test_split: to split the dataset into training and testing subsets.accuracy_score: to evaluate the model’s prediction accuracy.\nPython\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n2. Loading and Splitting the Iris Datasetdata = load_iris(): loads the Iris dataset, which includes features and target labels.X = data.data: extracts the feature matrix (input variables).y = data.target: extracts the target vector (class labels).train_test_split(...): splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with random_state=42 to ensure reproducibility.\nPython\ndata = load_iris()\nX = data.data\ny = data.target\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n3. Creating a Base ClassifierDecision tree is chosen as the base model. They are prone to overfitting when trained on small datasets making them good candidates for bagging.base_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(): initializes a Decision Tree classifier, which will serve as the base estimator in the Bagging ensemble.\nPython\nbase_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n4. Creating and Training the Bagging ClassifierA BaggingClassifier is created using the decision tree as the base classifier.n_estimators = 10 specifies that 10 decision trees will be trained on different bootstrapped subsets of the training data.\nPython\nbagging_classifier = BaggingClassifier(base_classifier, n_estimators=10, random_state=42)\nbagging_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n5. Making Predictions and Evaluating AccuracyThe trained bagging model predicts labels for test data.The accuracy of the predictions is calculated by comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) to the actual labels (y_test).\nPython\ny_pred = bagging_classifier.predict(X_test)\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\nOutput:Accuracy: 1.02. Boosting AlgorithmBoosting is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. Weak models are trained in series such that each next model tries to correct errors of the previous model until the entire training dataset is predicted correctly. One of the most well-known boosting algorithms is AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting). Here is an overview of Boosting algorithm:Initialize Model Weights: Begin with a single weak learner and assign equal weights to all training examples.Train Weak Learner: Train weak learners on these dataset.Sequential Learning: Boosting works by training models sequentially where each model focuses on correcting the errors of its predecessor. Boosting typically uses a single type of weak learner like decision trees.Weight Adjustment: Boosting assigns weights to training datapoints. Misclassified examples receive higher weights in the next iteration so that next models pay more attention to them.Python pseudo code for boosting Estimator implementing libraries:1. Importing Libraries and ModulesAdaBoostClassifier from sklearn.ensemble: for building the AdaBoost ensemble model.DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree: as the base weak learner for AdaBoost.load_iris from sklearn.datasets: to load the Iris dataset.train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection: to split the dataset into training and testing sets.accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics: to evaluate the model’s accuracy.\nPython\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n2. Loading and Splitting the Datasetdata = load_iris(): loads the Iris dataset, which includes features and target labels.X = data.data: extracts the feature matrix (input variables).y = data.target: extracts the target vector (class labels).train_test_split(...): splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with random_state=42 to ensure reproducibility.\nPython\ndata = load_iris()\nX = data.data\ny = data.target\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n3. Defining the Weak LearnerWe are creating the base classifier as a decision tree with maximum depth 1 (a decision stump). This simple tree will act as a weak learner for the AdaBoost algorithm, which iteratively improves by combining many such weak learners.\nPython\nbase_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)\n4. Creating and Training the AdaBoost Classifierbase_classifier: The weak learner used in boosting.n_estimators = 50: Number of weak learners to train sequentially.learning_rate = 1.0: Controls the contribution of each weak learner to the final model.random_state = 42: Ensures reproducibility.\nPython\nadaboost_classifier = AdaBoostClassifier(\nbase_classifier, n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1.0, random_state=42\n)\nadaboost_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n5. Making Predictions and Calculating AccuracyWe are calculating the accuracy of the model by comparing the true labels y_test with the predicted labels y_pred. The accuracy_score function returns the proportion of correctly predicted samples. Then, we print the accuracy value.\nPython\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\nOutput:Accuracy: 1.0Benefits of Ensemble Learning in Machine LearningEnsemble learning is a versatile approach that can be applied to machine learning model for: -Reduction in Overfitting: By aggregating predictions of multiple model's ensembles can reduce overfitting that individual complex models might exhibit.Improved Generalization: It generalizes better to unseen data by minimizing variance and bias.Increased Accuracy: Combining multiple models gives higher predictive accuracy.Robustness to Noise: It mitigates the effect of noisy or incorrect data points by averaging out predictions from diverse models.Flexibility: It can work with diverse models including decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines making them highly adaptable.Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Techniques like bagging reduce variance, while boosting reduces bias leading to better overall performance.There are various ensemble learning techniques we can use as each one of them has their own pros and cons.Ensemble Learning TechniquesTechniqueCategoryDescriptionRandom ForestBaggingRandom forest constructs multiple decision trees on bootstrapped subsets of the data and aggregates their predictions for final output, reducing overfitting and variance.Random Subspace MethodBaggingTrains models on random subsets of input features to enhance diversity and improve generalization while reducing overfitting.Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)BoostingGradient Boosting Machines sequentially builds decision trees, with each tree correcting errors of the previous ones, enhancing predictive accuracy iteratively.Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)BoostingXGBoost do optimizations like tree pruning, regularization, and parallel processing for robust and efficient predictive models.AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)BoostingAdaBoost focuses on challenging examples by assigning weights to data points.

Unlike supervised learning, where the data is labeled with a specific category or outcome, unsupervised learning algorithms are tasked with finding patterns and relationships within the data without any prior knowledge of the data's meaning. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms find hidden patterns and data without any human intervention, i.e., we don't give output to our model. The training model has only input parameter values and discovers the groups or patterns on its own. Unsupervised Learning The image shows set of animals: elephants, camels, and cows that represents raw data that the unsupervised learning algorithm will process. The \"Interpretation\" stage signifies that the algorithm doesn't have predefined labels or categories for the data. It needs to figure out how to group or organize the data based on inherent patterns.Algorithm represents the core of unsupervised learning process using techniques like clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection to identify patterns and structures in the data.Processing stage shows the algorithm working on the data.The output shows the results of the unsupervised learning process. In this case, the algorithm might have grouped the animals into clusters based on their species (elephants, camels, cows).How does unsupervised learning work?Unsupervised learning works by analyzing unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships. The data is not labeled with any predefined categories or outcomes, so the algorithm must find these patterns and relationships on its own. This can be a challenging task, but it can also be very rewarding, as it can reveal insights into the data that would not be apparent from a labeled dataset.Data-set in Figure A is Mall data that contains information about its clients that subscribe to them. Once subscribed they are provided a membership card and the mall has complete information about the customer and his/her every purchase. Now using this data and unsupervised learning techniques, the mall can easily group clients based on the parameters we are feeding in. The input to the unsupervised learning models is as follows: Unstructured data: May contain noisy(meaningless) data, missing values, or unknown dataUnlabeled data: Data only contains a value for input parameters, there is no targeted value(output). It is easy to collect as compared to the labeled one in the Supervised approach.Unsupervised Learning AlgorithmsThere are mainly 3 types of Algorithms which are used for Unsupervised dataset.ClusteringAssociation Rule LearningDimensionality Reduction 1. Clustering AlgorithmsClustering in unsupervised machine learning is the process of grouping unlabeled data into clusters based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge of the data's meaning. Broadly this technique is applied to group data based on different patterns, such as similarities or differences, our machine model finds. These algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups. For example, in the above figure, we have not given output parameter values, so this technique will be used to group clients based on the input parameters provided by our data.Some common clustering algorithms: K-means Clustering: Groups data into K clusters based on how close the points are to each other.Hierarchical Clustering: Creates clusters by building a tree step-by-step, either merging or splitting groups.Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN): Finds clusters in dense areas and treats scattered points as noise.Mean-Shift Clustering: Discovers clusters by moving points toward the most crowded areas.Spectral Clustering: Groups data by analyzing connections between points using graphs.2. Association Rule LearningAssociation rule learning is also known as association rule mining is a common technique used to discover associations in unsupervised machine learning. This technique is a rule-based ML technique that finds out some very useful relations between parameters of a large data set. This technique is basically used for market basket analysis that helps to better understand the relationship between different products.For e.g. shopping stores use algorithms based on this technique to find out the relationship between the sale of one product w.r.t to another's sales based on customer behavior. Like if a customer buys milk, then he may also buy bread, eggs, or butter. Once trained well, such models can be used to increase their sales by planning different offers.Some common Association Rule Learning algorithms: Apriori Algorithm: Finds patterns by exploring frequent item combinations step-by-step.FP-Growth Algorithm: An Efficient Alternative to Apriori. It quickly identifies frequent patterns without generating candidate sets.Eclat Algorithm: Uses intersections of itemsets to efficiently find frequent patterns.Efficient Tree-based Algorithms: Scales to handle large datasets by organizing data in tree structures.3. Dimensionality Reduction Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. This technique is useful for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms and for data visualization. Imagine a dataset of 100 features about students (height, weight, grades, etc.). To focus on key traits, you reduce it to just 2 features: height and grades, making it easier to visualize or analyze the data.Here are some popular Dimensionality Reduction algorithms:Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensions by transforming data into uncorrelated principal components.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Reduces dimensions while maximizing class separability for classification tasks.Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): Breaks data into non-negative parts to simplify representation.Locally Linear Embedding (LLE): Reduces dimensions while preserving the relationships between nearby points.Isomap: Captures global data structure by preserving distances along a manifold.Challenges of Unsupervised LearningHere are the key challenges of unsupervised learning:Noisy Data: Outliers and noise can distort patterns and reduce the effectiveness of algorithms.Assumption Dependence: Algorithms often rely on assumptions (e.g., cluster shapes), which may not match the actual data structure.Overfitting Risk: Overfitting can occur when models capture noise instead of meaningful patterns in the data.Limited Guidance: The absence of labels restricts the ability to guide the algorithm toward specific outcomes.Cluster Interpretability: Results, such as clusters, may lack clear meaning or alignment with real-world categories.Sensitivity to Parameters: Many algorithms require careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters in k-means.Lack of Ground Truth: Unsupervised learning lacks labeled data, making it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of results.Applications of Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning has diverse applications across industries and domains. Key applications include:Customer Segmentation: Algorithms cluster customers based on purchasing behavior or demographics, enabling targeted marketing strategies.Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns in data, aiding fraud detection, cybersecurity, and equipment failure prevention.Recommendation Systems: Suggests products, movies, or music by analyzing user behavior and preferences.Image and Text Clustering: Groups similar images or documents for tasks like organization, classification, or content recommendation.Social Network Analysis: Detects communities or trends in user interactions on social media platforms.Astronomy and Climate Science: Classifies galaxies or groups weather patterns to support scientific research\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nK means Clustering – Introduction\nM\nmohit gupta_omg :)\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learning\nSimilar Reads\nMachine Learning Tutorial  Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.Additional Types:Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered a subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.Module 1: Machine Learning PipelineIn order to make predictions there are some steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions. ML workflowData CleaningFeature ScalingData Preprocessing in PythonModule 2: Supervised Learning Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types: Classification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories Regression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values. Supervised Learning There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are:1. Linear RegressionThis is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output.Introduction to Linear RegressionGradient Descent in Linear RegressionMultiple Linear RegressionRidge RegressionLasso regressionElastic net Regression2. Logistic RegressionUsed when the output is a \"yes or no\" type answer. It helps in predicting categories like pass/fail or spam/not spam.Understanding Logistic RegressionCost function in Logistic Regression3. Decision TreesA model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a flowchart. Easy to understand and use.Decision Tree in Machine LearningTypes of Decision tree algorithmsDecision Tree - Regression (Implementation)Decision tree - Classification (Implementation)4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)A bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate different categories of data.Understanding SVMsSVM Hyperparameter Tuning - GridSearchCVNon-Linear SVM5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)This model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions.

The article discusses the process involved in performing Swiss Roll reduction with LLE, including the steps of loading and preprocessing the data, fitting the LLE model, and visualizing the reduced data. The article also provides a Python implementation of the process, with a code walkthrough and output examples. The article concludes with observations on the effectiveness of LLE in reducing the dimensionality of the Swiss Roll dataset.What is Swiss Roll?The Swiss roll is a toy dataset in scikit learn that is commonly used for testing and demonstrating nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms. It consists of a set of points in three dimensions, arranged in a \"roll\" shape, such that the points on the roll are mapped to a two-dimensional plane in a nonlinear fashion. The points on the Swiss roll are often colored so that the resulting plot of the reduced data can be visualized more easily.The Swiss roll dataset is often used because it is easy to generate and visualize, and because it exhibits a nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA. It is also a useful benchmark for comparing the performance of different nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms.What is Swiss Roll reduction?Swiss roll reduction is the process of reducing the dimensionality of the Swiss roll dataset from three dimensions to two or fewer dimensions, using a dimensionality reduction algorithm. The goal of this process is to represent the original data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the underlying structure of the data as possible.There are many techniques that can be used for Swiss roll reduction, including linear techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and nonlinear techniques such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, and t-SNE. Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses and can be more or less effective depending on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.In general, linear techniques such as PCA are faster and more computationally efficient, but may not be able to capture complex nonlinear structures in the data. Nonlinear techniques, on the other hand, can capture more complex structures but may be slower and more computationally intensive. Choosing the right technique for Swiss roll reduction will depend on the specific goals of the analysis and the characteristics of the data.What is Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)?Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is a method for nonlinear dimensionality reduction that is based on the idea of modeling the local structure of the data by reconstructing it from a linear combination of its neighbors. The idea behind LLE is to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the relationships between nearby points while ignoring the relationships between more distant points.To perform LLE, the algorithm first selects a set of neighbors for each point in the data, based on some measure of similarity such as Euclidean distance. It then fits a linear model to these neighbors, using the original high-dimensional coordinates as the input variables and the low-dimensional coordinates as the output variables. This allows the algorithm to reconstruct each point in the data as a linear combination of its neighbors, using the low-dimensional coordinates as the coefficients. The low-dimensional coordinates are then optimized to minimize the reconstruction error.LLE has a number of attractive properties, including its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its ability to preserve the local structure of the data. However, it can be sensitive to the choice of the number of neighbors and the dimensionality of the output space, and may not perform well on data with a complex global structure.The process involved in Swiss Roll reduction with LLE?Here is a general outline of the process involved in reducing the dimensionality of the Swiss roll dataset using Locally Linear Embedding (LLE):Load the Swiss roll dataset: The first step is to load the Swiss roll dataset and store it in a variable X. This can be done using scikit-learn's make_swiss_roll function.Fit the LLE model to the data: Next, you can use scikit-learn's LocallyLinearEmbedding class to fit an LLE model to the data. This requires specifying the number of dimensions in the reduced data (n_components) and the number of neighbors to use in the reconstruction process (n_neighbors). You can also specify other optional parameters, such as the distance metric to use for selecting neighbors.Transform the data: Once the LLE model has been fit to the data, you can use the transform method to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This will return a new set of coordinates for the data points, with the specified number of dimensions.Optionally, compute the reconstruction error of the model using the reconstruction_error_ attribute of the LocallyLinearEmbedding object.Visualize the reduced data: Finally, you can visualize the reduced data using a scatter plot or other suitable visualization technique. This can help you understand the structure of the data and assess the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction process. Plot the original Swiss Roll data in 3D and the transformed data in the lower-dimensional space using Matplotlib.Here is an example of a comprehensive Python code that demonstrates how to use Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) for Swiss roll reduction in scikit-learn, including pre-processing and comparison with PCA, and visualization steps\nPython\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_swiss_roll\nfrom sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n# Generate the data\nX, y = make_swiss_roll(n_samples=2000, noise=0.5)\n# Fit the model with LLE\nlle = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_components=2, n_neighbors=10)\nX_lle = lle.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_lle = lle.reconstruction_error_\n# Fit the model with PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_pca = 1 - sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)\nIn this code, we are using the make_swiss_roll function from scikit-learn to generate a synthetic 3D dataset, known as the Swiss Roll. The Swiss Roll is a toy dataset used for demonstrating nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. It consists of a rolled-up 2D plane, with points on the plane randomly distributed and colored.\nPython\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_swiss_roll\nfrom sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n# Generate the data\nX, y = make_swiss_roll(n_samples=2000,\nnoise=0.5)\nNext, we apply two different dimensionality reduction techniques to the Swiss Roll dataset: Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), PCA is applied for comparison purposes with LLE. LLE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that seeks to preserve the local structure of the data by reconstructing each point as a linear combination of its neighbors. PCA, on the other hand, is a linear dimensionality reduction method that seeks to find the directions of maximum variance in the data and projects the data onto a new lower-dimensional space along these directions.To apply LLE, we use the LocallyLinearEmbedding class from scikit-learn. We initialize the class with the number of dimensions we want to reduce the data to (in this case, 2), and the number of neighbors to use for the reconstruction of each point. Then, we fit the model to the data using the fit_transform method, which returns the transformed data in the lower-dimensional space. We also compute the reconstruction error of the LLE model using the reconstruction_error_ attribute of the LocallyLinearEmbedding object.\nPython\n# Fit the model with LLE\nlle = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_components=2,\nn_neighbors=10)\nX_lle = lle.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_lle = lle.reconstruction_error_\nTo apply PCA, we use the PCA class from scikit-learn. We initialize the class with the number of dimensions we want to reduce the data to (in this case, 2) and fit the model to the data using the fit_transform method, which returns the transformed data in the lower-dimensional space. We also compute the reconstruction error of the PCA model by summing up the explained variance ratios of the selected components.\nPython\n# Fit the model with PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_pca = 1 - sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)\nFinally, we plot the original Swiss Roll data in 3D, the transformed Swiss Roll data using LLE in 2D, and the transformed Swiss Roll data using PCA in 2D. The plots show the data points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane, so we can see how well the dimensionality reduction techniques have preserved the structure of the data. The plot titles also display the reconstruction error for each method.\nPython\n# Plot the original data\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], X[:, 2],\nc=y, cmap=plt.cm.cool)\nplt.title('Original Swiss Roll')\nplt.show()\nOutput: In the plot of the original Swiss Roll data, you should see a 3D scatterplot with points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane. The points should form a spiral shape, with the colors changing smoothly along the spiral. This represents the original structure of the data, with points on the plane randomly distributed and colored.\nPython\n# Plot the transformed data with LLE\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.scatter(X_lle[:, 0], X_lle[:, 1], c=y, cmap=plt.cm.cool)\nplt.title(\nf'Transformed Swiss Roll with LLE\\\n(reconstruction error = {reconstruction_error_lle:.2f})')\nplt.show()\nOutput: In the plot of the transformed Swiss Roll data using LLE, you should see a 2D scatterplot with points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane.\nPython\n# Plot the transformed data with PCA\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1],\nc=y, cmap=plt.cm.cool)\nplt.title(\nf'Transformed Swiss Roll with PCA \\\n(reconstruction error = {reconstruction_error_pca:.2f})')\nplt.show()\nOutput: In the plot of the transformed Swiss Roll data using PCA, you should see a 2D scatterplot with points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane. The points should not necessarily form a spiral shape, as PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction method and may not be able to capture the nonlinear structure of the data. However, the points should still be somewhat ordered by color, indicating that PCA has been able to preserve some of the structure of the data by finding the directions of maximum variance.Overall, the output plots allow us to compare the performance of LLE and PCA in preserving the structure of the Swiss Roll data after dimensionality reduction. The reconstruction error for each method, displayed in the plot titles, provides a quantitative measure of this performance. A lower reconstruction error indicates better preservation of the original structure of the data.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nOrdinary Least Squares (OLS) using statsmodels\nV\nvinayedula\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nTechnical Scripter\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nTechnical Scripter 2022\npython\n+1 More\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learningpython\nSimilar Reads\nMachine Learning Algorithms  Machine learning algorithms are essentially sets of instructions that allow computers to learn from data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.Additional Types:Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered a subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.Module 1: Machine Learning PipelineIn order to make predictions there are some steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions. ML workflowData CleaningFeature ScalingData Preprocessing in PythonModule 2: Supervised Learning Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types: Classification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories Regression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values. Supervised Learning There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are:1. Linear RegressionThis is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output.Introduction to Linear RegressionGradient Descent in Linear RegressionMultiple Linear RegressionRidge RegressionLasso regressionElastic net Regression2. Logistic RegressionUsed when the output is a \"yes or no\" type answer.

Random Forest (Bagging Algorithm)A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability.Introduction to Random forestRandom Forest ClassifierRandom Forest RegressionHyperparameter Tuning in Random ForestIntroduction to Ensemble LearningEnsemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning:Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently.Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one.Module 3: Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose: Clustering Association Rule MiningDimensionality Reduction. Unsupervised learning1. ClusteringClustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. Types of clustering algorithms are:Centroid-based Methods:K-Means clusteringElbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeansK-Means++ clusteringK-Mode clusteringFuzzy C-Means (FCM) ClusteringDistribution-based Methods: Gaussian mixture modelsExpectation-Maximization AlgorithmDirichlet process mixture models (DPMMs)Connectivity based methods: Hierarchical clustering Agglomerative ClusteringDivisive clusteringAffinity propagationDensity Based methods: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)2.

In this article we will be apply RNNs to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews from Swiggy food delivery platform. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative for providing insights into customer experiences.We will conduct a Sentiment Analysis using the TensorFlow framework: 1. Importing Libraries and DatasetHere we will be importing numpy, pandas, Regular Expression (RegEx), scikit learn and tenserflow.\nPython\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense, Embedding\n2. Loading DatasetWe will be using swiggy dataset of customer reviews. You can download dataset from here. pd.read_csv() : Reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFramedata.columns : Accesses the column names of the DataFrametolist() : Converts the column names from an Index object to a regular Python list\nPython\ndata = pd.read_csv('swiggy.csv')\nprint(\"Columns in the dataset:\")\nprint(data.columns.tolist())\nOutput:Columns in the dataset: ['ID', 'Area', 'City', 'Restaurant Price', 'Avg Rating', 'Total Rating', 'Food Item', 'Food Type', 'Delivery Time', 'Review']3. Text Cleaning and Sentiment LabelingWe will clean the review text, create a sentiment label based on ratings and remove any missing values.data[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].str.lower() : Converts all text in the \"Review\" column to lowercasedata[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].replace(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', regex=True) : Removes all characters except letters, numbers and spaces from the \"Review\" columndata['sentiment'] = data['Avg Rating'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 3.5 else 0) : Creates a new \"sentiment\" column with 1 for ratings above 3.5 and 0 otherwisedata = data.dropna() : Removes rows that contain any missing values\nPython\ndata[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].str.lower()\ndata[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].replace(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', regex=True)\ndata['sentiment'] = data['Avg Rating'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 3.5 else 0)\ndata = data.dropna()\n4. Tokenization and PaddingWe will prepare the text data by tokenizing and padding it and extract the target sentiment labels. Tokenizer converts words into integer sequences and padding ensures all input sequences have the same length (max_length).max_features = 5000 : Sets the maximum number of words to keep in the tokenizermax_length = 200 : Defines the fixed length for each input sequence after paddingTokenizer(num_words=max_features) : Initializes the tokenizer to keep the top 5000 words onlytokenizer.fit_on_texts(data[\"Review\"]) : Builds the word index based on the reviews in the datasettokenizer.texts_to_sequences(data[\"Review\"]) : Converts each review into a sequence of word indexespad_sequences(..., maxlen=max_length) : Pads or truncates each sequence to the same length (200)y = data['sentiment'].values : Extracts the sentiment labels as a NumPy array for model training\nPython\nmax_features = 5000\nmax_length = 200\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=max_features)\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts(data[\"Review\"])\nX = pad_sequences(tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(data[\"Review\"]), maxlen=max_length)\ny = data['sentiment'].values\nNote: These concepts are a not a part of RNN but are done to make model prediction better. You can refer to tokenization and padding for more details.5. Splitting the DataWe will split the data into training, validation and test sets while maintaining the class distribution.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y) : Splits data into 80% training and 20% test sets, preserving sentiment class balancetrain_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.1, random_state=42, stratify=y_train) : Further splits training data into 90% training and 10% validation sets, keeping class distribution consistent\nPython\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\nX, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y\n)\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(\nX_train, y_train, test_size=0.1, random_state=42, stratify=y_train\n)\n6. Building RNN ModelWe will build and compile a simple RNN model for binary sentiment classification.Sequential([...]) : Creates a sequential neural network modelEmbedding(input_dim=max_features, output_dim=16, input_length=max_length) : Maps input words to 16-dimensional vectorsSimpleRNN(64, activation='tanh', return_sequences=False) : Adds a recurrent layer with 64 units using tanh activationDense(1, activation='sigmoid') : Adds an output layer with one neuron using sigmoid activation for binary outputmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) : Configures the model with binary crossentropy loss, Adam optimizer and accuracy metric\nPython\nmodel = Sequential([\nEmbedding(input_dim=max_features, output_dim=16, input_length=max_length),\nSimpleRNN(64, activation='tanh', return_sequences=False),\nDense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n])\nmodel.compile(\nloss='binary_crossentropy',\noptimizer='adam',\nmetrics=['accuracy']\n)\n7. Training and Evaluating ModelWe will train the model on training data, validate it during training, then evaluate its performance on test data.model.fit(...) : Trains the model for 5 epochs with batch size 32, validating on the validation setmodel.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0) : Evaluates the trained model on test data without extra outputprint(f\"Test accuracy: {score[1]:.2f}\") : Prints the test accuracy rounded to two decimal places\nPython\nhistory = model.fit(\nX_train, y_train,\nepochs=5,\nbatch_size=32,\nvalidation_data=(X_val, y_val),\nverbose=1\n)\nscore = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)\nprint(f\"Test accuracy: {score[1]:.2f}\")\nOutput: Training and Evaluating ModelOur model achieved a accuracy of 72% which is great for a RNN model. We can further fine tune it to achieve more accuracy. 8. Predicting SentimentWe will create a function to preprocess a single review, predict its sentiment and display the result.review_text.lower() : Converts the input review text to lowercasere.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', text) : Removes all characters except letters, numbers and spacestokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text]) : Converts the cleaned review into a sequence of word indexespad_sequences(seq, maxlen=max_length) : Pads the sequence to the fixed lengthmodel.predict(padded)[0][0] : Predicts the sentiment probability for the reviewReturns \"Positive\" if prediction is 0.5 or above, otherwise \"Negative\", including the probability score\nPython\ndef predict_sentiment(review_text):\ntext = review_text.lower()\ntext = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', text)\nseq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])\npadded = pad_sequences(seq, maxlen=max_length)\nprediction = model.predict(padded)[0][0]\nreturn f\"{'Positive' if prediction >= 0.5 else 'Negative'} (Probability: {prediction:.2f})\"\nsample_review = \"The food was great.\"\nprint(f\"Review: {sample_review}\")\nprint(f\"Sentiment: {predict_sentiment(sample_review)}\")\nOutput: Predicting SentimentIn summary the model processes textual reviews through RNN to predict sentiment from raw data. This helps in actionable insights by understanding customer sentiment.You can download the source code from here.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nText Generation using Recurrent Long Short Term Memory Network\nM\nmazumdarabhishek94\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nPython\nNeural Network\nPractice Tags :\npython\nSimilar Reads\nDeep Learning Tutorial  Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to learn from large datasets using multi-layered neural networks.

They consist of layers of neurons that transform the input data into meaningful outputs through a series of mathematical operations. In this article, we are going to explore different types of neural networks. Neural Network basic framework1. Feedforward Neural NetworksFeedforward neural networks are a form of artificial neural network where without forming any cycles between layers or nodes means inputs can pass data through those nodes within the hidden level to the output nodes.Architecture: Made up of layers with unidirectional flow of data i.e from input through hidden and the output layer.Training: Backpropagation is often used during training for the main aim of reducing the prediction errors.Applications: In visual and voice recognition, NLP, financial forecasting and recommending systemWhen to use: Best for general-purpose tasks like classification and regression. Ideal when data is static and has no sequential dependencies.2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)Convolutional neural networks structure is focused on processing the grid type data like images and videos by using convolutional layers filtering driving the patterns and spatial hierarchies.Key Components: Utilizing convolutional layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers.Applications: Used for classification of images, object detection, medical imaging analyzes, autonomous driving and visualization in augmented reality.When to use: Use when working with image, video or grid-structured data.3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)Recurrent neural network handles sequential data in which the current output is a result of previous inputs by looping over themselves to hold internal state (memory).Architecture: Contains recurrent connections that enable feedback loops for processing sequences.Challenges: Problems such as vanishing gradients become apparent since they limit capturing interdependence on a long scale.Applications: Language translation, open-ended text classification, ones to ones interaction and time series prediction are its applications.When to use: Use for tasks involving sequences like text, speech or time series.4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) are a variant of RNNs. They exhibit memory cells to solve the disappearing gradient issue and keep large ranges of information in their memory.Key Features: Capture memory cells in pass information flowing and graduate greediness issue.Applications: Value of RNNs is in terms of importing long-term memory into the model like language translation and time-series forecasting.When to use: Use when you need to model long-term dependencies in sequences.5. Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) is the second usual variant of RNNs which is working on gating mechanism just like LSTM but with little parameter.Advantages: Vanishing gradient issue is addressed and it is compute-efficient than LSTM.Applications: LSTM is also involved in tasks that can be categorized as similar to speech recognition and text monitoring.When to use: Use when LSTM-like performance is needed but with lower computational cost.Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)6. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs)Radial basis function (RBF) networks can be regarded as models which define radial basis functions that are very useful in the function approximation and classification approaches and is used in complex input-output data modelling.Applications: It includes regression, pattern recognition and system control methods for fast-tracking.When to use: Good choice for function approximation and small to medium-scale classification tasks.7. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)Self-Organizing Maps are unsupervised neural networks, these networks are used for unsupervised cluster generation based on the retaining of topological features of the high dimensional data from an upper dimensional source, transformed into low dimensional form of output data.Features: Design methods that reduces the dimension of data from the high dimension into a low dimension without loss of the underlying geometry of the data.Applications: Visualizing data, discovering customers segments, locating anomalies and selecting needed features.When to use: Ideal for data visualization, clustering and dimensionality reduction.8. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)The architecture of the Deep Belief Networks is built on many stochastic, latent variables that are used for both deep supervised and unsupervised tasks such as nonlinear feature learning and mid dimensional representation.Function: If you are looking for the most effective architecture of data that can be learned via classification, this algorithm is very useful.Applications: Image and voice recognition, natural language understanding and smart devices as recommendations systems.When to use: Use when you're interested in unsupervised pre-training or deep feature extraction.9. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)Generative Adversarial Networks has made up of of two neural networks, the generator and discriminator which compete against each other. The generator creates a fake generated data and the discriminator learns to differentiate the real from and fake data.Working Principle: Generator evolves after each iteration while the fake data being generated. This simultaneously makes the discriminator more discriminating as it determines whether the components are real or generated.Applications: They have proved useful not only for pattern generation but also data augmentation, style transfer and learning without any supervision.When to use: Use when you need to generate realistic synthetic data.10. Autoencoders (AE)Autoencoders are feedforward networks (ANNs) that are trained to acquire the most helpful presentations of the information through the process of re-coding the input data. The encoder is pinpointed to precisely map the input into the legal latent space representation while the decoder does the opposite, decoding the space from this representation.Functionality: Help in techniques like dimensionality reduction, information extraction, noise removal and generative modelling the images become comprehensible.Types: Variants include undercomplete, overcomplete and variational autoencoders.When to use: Use for unsupervised learning tasks like data compression, noise removal and anomaly detection.11. Siamese Neural NetworksSiamese Neural Network work with networks of the same structure and an identical architecture. Comparison is being made via a similarity metric that can tell the degree of resemblance the two networks have.Applications: Face recognition as the signature, retrieval of information, image similarity comparison and category tasks.When to use: Ideal when comparing two inputs to determine similarity like face verification.12. Capsule Networks (CapsNet)The layers of Capsule Networks do not only incorporate localization relations of data but allows multilevel structure by passing the information from lower convolutional layers to higher. They use cyclicals to the items and their bodies too, of course, they do not do that at the same time.Applications: Image classification, object detection and scene understanding via the immense visual data exposure.When to use: Use for image classification where part-to-whole relationships matter.13. Transformer NetworksTransformer Networks do this by way of self-attention mechanism which results into a parallel process used for making the tokenization inputs faster and thus improved capturing of long range dependencies.Key Features: Provides better performance than any of the other models due to their capability to process natural language sufficiently and handle tasks related to machine translation, generating text and document summarization.Applications: The application of this technology had got more popular, specially in language understanding tasks and image and audio data processing applications of this time and more similar tasks.When to use: Use for NLP tasks like translation, text generation and summarization.14. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)Main thing related with Spiking Neural Networks is the brain functionality which is processed by action potentials (spikes) in biological neurons in the same way. These are the key factors of \"neuromorphic\" technology which perform the deep learning and avoid another type of processing as well.Applications: Neuromorphic processes, learning and computation in spiro-neural computing, cognitive processes modeling and mind-related computing are also carried out with this.When to use: Use when working on neuromorphic computing and biologically inspired architectures.Applications of Neural NetworksThe uses of neural networks are diverse and cut across many distinct industries and domains. Some of its applications are:Healthcare: Neural networks play a critical role in medical image analysis, disease diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, drug discovery and healthcare management systems.Finance: They have a very strong influence on algorithmic trading, fraud detection, credit scoring, risk management and portfolio optimization.Entertainment: They allow development of recommendation systems for movies, music, books and character animation as well as virtual reality experiences.Manufacturing: They innovate in supply chain management especially in optimizing it, predictive maintenance, quality control processes and industrial automation.Transportation: The human brain is incorporated into the auto-piloted cars for the purpose of perception, making decisions and navigation.Environmental Sciences: They help construct climate models, satellite monitoring and ecological observation.\nTypes of Neural Networks\nVisit Course\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nLayers in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\nK\nkolisuszprv\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nBlogathon\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nNeural Network\nData Science Blogathon 2024\n+1 More\nSimilar Reads\nDeep Learning Tutorial  Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to learn from large datasets using multi-layered neural networks.

But sparse autoencoders go one step ahead by introducing a regularization term to avoid overfitting and forcing the learning of compact, interpretable features. This ensures that the network is not merely copying the input data but rather learns a compressed, meaningful representation of the data.Objective Function of a Sparse AutoencoderL = ||X - \\hat{X}||^2 + \\lambda \\cdot \\text{Penalty}(s)X: Input data.\\hat{X}: Reconstructed output.\\lambda: Regularization parameter.Penalty(s): A function that penalizes deviations from sparsity, often implemented using KL-divergence.Techniques for Enforcing SparsityThere are several methods to enforce the sparsity constraint:L1 Regularization: Introduces a penalty proportional to the absolute weight values, encouraging the model to utilize fewer features.KL Divergence: Estimates how much the average activation of hidden neurons deviates from the target sparsity level, such that a subset of neurons is activated at any time.Training Sparse AutoencodersTraining a sparse autoencoder typically involves:Initialization: Weights are initialized randomly or using pre-trained networks.Forward Pass: The input is fed through the encoder to obtain the latent representation, followed by the decoder to reconstruct the output.Loss Calculation: The loss function is computed, incorporating both the reconstruction error and the sparsity penalty.Backpropagation: The gradients are calculated and used to update the weights.Preventing the Autoencoder from OverfittingSparse autoencoders address an important issue in normal autoencoders: overfitting. In a normal autoencoder with an increased hidden layer, the network can simply \"cheat\" and replicate the input data to the output without deriving useful features. Sparse autoencoders address this by restricting how many of the hidden layer neurons are active at any given time, thus nudging the network to learn only the most critical features.Implementation of a Sparse Autoencoder for MNIST DatasetThis is an implementation that shows how to construct a sparse autoencoder with TensorFlow and Keras  in order to learn useful representations of the MNIST dataset. The model induces sparsity in the hidden layer activations, making it helpful for applications such as feature extraction.Step 1: Import LibrariesWe start by importing the libraries required for handling the data, constructing the model, and visualization.\nPython\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nStep 2: Load and Preprocess the MNIST DatasetWe then load the MNIST dataset,  which is a set of handwritten digits. We preprocess the data as well by reshaping and normalizing the pixel values.Reshaping: We convert the 28x28 images into a flat vector of size 784.Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].\nPython\n(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()\nx_train = x_train.reshape((x_train.shape[0], -1)).astype('float32') / 255.0\nx_test = x_test.reshape((x_test.shape[0], -1)).astype('float32') / 255.0\nStep 3: Define Model ParametersWe define the model parameters, including the input dimension, hidden layer size, sparsity level, and the sparsity regularization weight.\nPython\ninput_dim = 784\nhidden_dim = 64\nsparsity_level = 0.05\nlambda_sparse = 0.1\nStep 4: Build the Autoencoder ModelWe construct the autoencoder model using Keras. The encoder reduces the dimension of the input data to lower dimensions, whereas the decoder attempts to recreate the original input based on this lower-dimensional representation.\nPython\ninputs = layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,))\nencoded = layers.Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')(inputs)\ndecoded = layers.Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)\nautoencoder = keras.Model(inputs, decoded)\nencoder = keras.Model(inputs, encoded)\nStep 5: Define the Sparse Loss FunctionWe create a custom loss function that includes both the mean squared error (MSE) and a sparsity penalty using KL divergence. This encourages the model to learn a sparse representation.\nPython\ndef sparse_loss(y_true, y_pred):\nmse_loss = tf.reduce_mean(keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y_true, y_pred))\nhidden_layer_output = encoder(y_true)\nmean_activation = tf.reduce_mean(hidden_layer_output, axis=0)\nkl_divergence = tf.reduce_sum(sparsity_level * tf.math.log(sparsity_level / (mean_activation + 1e-10)) +\n(1 - sparsity_level) * tf.math.log((1 - sparsity_level) / (1 - mean_activation + 1e-10)))\nreturn mse_loss + lambda_sparse * kl_divergence\nStep 6: Compile the ModelWe compile the model with the Adam optimizer and the custom sparse loss function.\nPython\nautoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=sparse_loss)\nStep 7: Train the AutoencoderThe model is trained on the training data for a specified number of epochs. We shuffle the data to ensure better training.\nPython\nhistory = autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=50, batch_size=256, shuffle=True)\nOutput: Epoch 1/50235/235 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 4s 8ms/step - loss: 0.2632. . .Epoch 50/50235/235 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 2s 5ms/step - loss: 0.0281Step 8: Reconstruct the InputsAfter training, we use the autoencoder to reconstruct the test data and visualize the results.\nPython\nreconstructed = autoencoder.predict(x_test)\nStep 9: Visualize Original vs. Reconstructed ImagesWe visualize the original images alongside their reconstructed counterparts to assess the model's performance.\nPython\nn = 10\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 4))\nfor i in range(n):\n# Original images\nax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1)\nplt.imshow(x_test[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')\nplt.title(\"Original\")\nplt.axis('off')\n# Reconstructed images\nax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1 + n)\nplt.imshow(reconstructed[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')\nplt.title(\"Reconstructed\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\nOutput: Reconstructed ImagesStep 10: Analyze Encoded RepresentationsWe obtain the encoded representations and visualize them to understand the features learned by the autoencoder.\nPython\nencoded_outputs = encoder.predict(x_train)\n# Visualize encoded features\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.scatter(encoded_outputs[:, 0], encoded_outputs[:, 1])  # Assuming hidden_dim is 2 for visualization\nplt.title(\"Encoded Representations\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Encoded Dimension 1\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Encoded Dimension 2\")\nplt.show()\nOutputEncoded RepresentationsStep 11: Analyze Mean Activation of Hidden UnitsFinally, we analyze the mean activation of the hidden units to understand how sparsity is achieved in the model.\nPython\nmean_activation = np.mean(encoded_outputs, axis=0)\nplt.bar(range(len(mean_activation)), mean_activation)\nplt.title(\"Mean Activation of Hidden Units\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Hidden Units\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Mean Activation\")\nplt.show()\nOutputMean ActivationApplications of Sparse AutoencodersSparse autoencoders have a wide range of applications in various fields:Feature Learning: They can be employed to learn a sparse representation of high-dimensional data, which can subsequently be employed for classification or regression purposes.Image Denoising: Sparse autoencoders can be employed to denoise images by learning to capture salient features and disregard unnecessary noise.Anomaly Detection: By training on normal data, sparse autoencoders can identify outliers based on reconstruction error.Data Compression: They can effectively compress data by reducing its dimensionality while retaining important features.Advantages of Sparse AutoencodersEfficiency: They can learn efficient representations with fewer active neurons, leading to reduced computational costs.Interpretability: The sparsity constraint usually tends to create more interpretable features, which in turn can assist in interpreting the underlying structure of the data.Robustness: Sparse autoencoders have the potential to be more resistant to noise and overfitting because of the regularization effect they provide.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAutoencoders in Machine Learning\nA\narupchowdhury50\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nSimilar Reads\nMasked Autoencoders in Deep Learning Masked autoencoders are neural network models designed to reconstruct input data from partially masked or corrupted versions, helping the model learn robust feature representations.

Their ability to learn hierarchical representations of visual data makes them exceptionally powerful. A critical component of training CNNs is backpropagation, the algorithm used for effectively updating the network's weights. This article delves into the mathematical underpinnings of backpropagation within CNNs, explaining how it works and its crucial role in neural network training.Understanding BackpropagationBackpropagation, short for \"backward propagation of errors,\" is an algorithm used to calculate the gradient of the loss function of a neural network with respect to its weights. It is essentially a method to update the weights to minimize the loss. Backpropagation is crucial because it tells us how to change our weights to improve our network’s performance.Role of Backpropagation in CNNsIn a CNN, backpropagation plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the filters and weights during training, allowing the network to better differentiate features in the input data. CNNs typically consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Each of these layers has weights and biases that are adjusted via backpropagation.Fundamentals of BackpropagationBackpropagation, in essence, is an application of the chain rule from calculus used to compute the gradients (partial derivatives) of a loss function with respect to the weights of the network. The process involves three main steps: the forward pass, loss calculation, and the backward pass.The Forward PassDuring the forward pass, input data (e.g., an image) is passed through the network to compute the output. For a CNN, this involves several key operations:Convolutional Layers: Each convolutional layer applies numerous filters to the input. For a given layer l with filters denoted by F, input I, and bias b, the output O is given by: O = (I * F) + b  Here, * denotes the convolution operation.Activation Functions: After convolution, an activation function σ\\sigmaσ (e.g., ReLU) is applied element-wise to introduce non-linearity: O = \\sigma((I * F) + b)Pooling Layers: Pooling (e.g., max pooling) reduces dimensionality, summarizing the features extracted by the convolutional layers.Loss CalculationAfter computing the output, a loss function L is calculated to assess the error in prediction. Common loss functions include mean squared error for regression tasks or cross-entropy loss for classification:L = -\\sum y \\log(\\hat{y})Here, y is the true label, and \\hat{y}​ is the predicted label.The Backward Pass (Backpropagation)The backward pass computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network by applying the chain rule:Gradient with respect to output: First, calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of the final layer: \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O}Gradient through activation function: Apply the chain rule through the activation function: \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O} \\frac{\\partial O}{\\partial I} For ReLU, \\frac{\\partial{O}}{\\partial{I}}​ is 1 for I > 0 and 0 otherwise.Gradient with respect to filters in convolutional layers: Continue applying the chain rule to find the gradients with respect to the filters:\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial F} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O} * rot180(I)Here, rot180(I) rotates the input by 180 degrees, aligning it for the convolution operation used to calculate the gradient with respect to the filter.Weight UpdateUsing the gradients calculated, the weights are updated using an optimization algorithm such as SGD:F_{new} = F_{old} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial F}Here, \\eta is the learning rate, which controls the step size during the weight update.Challenges in Backpropagation Vanishing GradientsIn deep networks, backpropagation can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become too small to make significant changes in weights, stalling the training. Advanced activation functions like ReLU and optimization techniques such as batch normalization are used to mitigate this issue.Exploding GradientsConversely, gradients can become excessively large; this is known as exploding gradients. This can be controlled by techniques such as gradient clipping.ConclusionBackpropagation in CNNs is a sophisticated yet elegantly mathematical process crucial for learning from vast amounts of visual data. Its effectiveness hinges on the intricate interplay of calculus, linear algebra, and numerical optimization techniques, which together enable CNNs to achieve remarkable performance in various applications ranging from autonomous driving to medical image analysis. Understanding and optimizing the backpropagation process is fundamental to pushing the boundaries of what neural networks can achieve.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nMath Behind Convolutional Neural Networks\nS\nsanjulika_sharma\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nComputer Vision\nAI-ML-DS\nDeep Learning\nSimilar Reads\nBackpropagation in Neural Network Back Propagation is also known as \"Backward Propagation of Errors\" is a method used to train neural network .

Feature Descriptors Feature Descriptors SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) How Does Computer Vision Work?Computer Vision works much like the human eye and brain. First, our eyes capture the image and send the visual data to our brain. The brain then processes this information and transforms it into a meaningful interpretation, recognizing and categorizing the object based on its properties.In a similar way, Computer Vision uses a camera (acting like the human eye) to capture images. The visual data is then processed by algorithms to recognize and identify the objects based on patterns it has learned. However, before the system can recognize objects in new images, it needs to be trained on a large dataset of labeled images. This training enables the system to identify and associate various patterns with their corresponding labels.For example, imagine providing a computer with thousands of bird song recordings. The system learns by analyzing features like pitch, rhythm and duration.

To do so we can see that name of each image of the training data set is either start with \"cat\" or \"dog\" so we will use that to our advantage then we use one hot encoder for the machine to understand the labels(cat[1, 0] or dog[0, 1]).\ndef label_img(img):\nword_label = img.split('.')[-3]\n# DIY One hot encoder\nif word_label == 'cat': return [1, 0]\nelif word_label == 'dog': return [0, 1]Libraries Required:\nTFLearn - Deep learning library featuring a higher-level API for TensorFlow used to create layers of our CNNtqdm - Instantly make your loops show a smart progress meter, just for simple design sakenumpy - To process the image matricesopen-cv - To process the image like converting them to grayscale and etc.os - To access the file system to read the image from the train and test directory from our machinesrandom - To shuffle the data to overcome the biasingmatplotlib - To display the result of our predictive outcome.TensorFlow - Just to use the tensorboard to compare the loss and adam curve our result data or obtained log.TRAIN_DIR and TEST_DIR should be set according to the user's convenience and play with the basic hyperparameters like an epoch, learning rate, etc to improve the accuracy. I have converted the image to grayscale so that we will only have to deal with a 2-d matrix otherwise 3-d matrix is tough to directly apply CNN to, especially not recommended for beginners.

Traditional machine learning models require large labeled datasets to recognize classes accurately. However, zero-shot learning (ZSL) introduces a paradigm shift by enabling models to recognize unseen classes without requiring direct training on them. A key breakthrough in this domain is the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, which leverages both text and image data for better generalization. In this article, we will explore zero-shot learning, novel class recognition, and how the CLIP model addresses these challenges effectively.What is Zero-Shot Learning?Zero-shot learning refers to the capability of a model to classify unseen classes without having explicit examples of them during training. Instead of learning from the labeled dataset, zero-shot learning relies on semantic information, such as descriptions of new classes, to recognize them. This is a significant leap from traditional supervised learning, where models are only as good as the data they are trained on.In a zero-shot learning scenario, the model is provided with knowledge about the attributes of the new class (like textual descriptions, context, or relationships to other classes) that helps in the classification process. This is especially useful in applications like object recognition, where it's impractical to collect and label data for every possible class.Example of Zero-Shot LearningImagine a model trained to recognize dogs, cats, and birds. In a zero-shot setting, when the model encounters an image of a horse (which it has never seen before), it can use a textual description like \"a four-legged animal often used for riding\" to correctly classify the image as a horse.Novel Class Recognition with Zero-Shot LearningNovel class recognition is a subset of zero-shot learning where the model is exposed to completely new categories that were not part of the training data. This requires the model to learn discriminative features from a predefined set of training classes and generalize these features to novel or unseen classes.The traditional approach to classifying novel classes requires additional fine-tuning on the new classes, but zero-shot learning enables the model to bypass this step. By using semantic relationships between classes (such as descriptive text or attributes), the model can effectively distinguish between seen and unseen classes.CLIP Model: A Game-Changer for Zero-Shot LearningThe Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, introduced by OpenAI, represents a significant advancement in zero-shot learning. Unlike traditional deep learning models that are limited to a fixed set of output classes, CLIP can generalize to new tasks and classes by combining image and text embeddings.How CLIP WorksCLIP is built on the idea of aligning images and text into a shared latent space. The key innovation here is that CLIP learns to understand the relationship between textual descriptions and corresponding images. During training, it uses a contrastive learning approach: matching image embeddings with their respective textual descriptions while pushing apart embeddings of mismatched pairs.This pretraining on large datasets of image-text pairs enables CLIP to perform zero-shot classification. Given an image of an unseen class, the model can compare it against possible textual descriptions of classes, even if it has never encountered the class directly.For instance, if CLIP has never seen a zebra, it can still recognize one if given a descriptive prompt such as \"an animal with black and white stripes.\"Benefits of CLIP for Zero-Shot LearningGeneralization Across Domains: CLIP's text-image alignment allows it to generalize not only to new classes but also across different tasks. Whether it’s object classification, style transfer, or action recognition, CLIP has demonstrated impressive flexibility.No Need for Task-Specific Training: Traditional models often require fine-tuning or retraining on new datasets to handle novel classes. CLIP bypasses this limitation by using textual descriptions as anchors for classification. Thus, there is no need for collecting and labeling new data every time a new class is introduced.Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Capabilities: CLIP is designed for both few-shot and zero-shot learning, making it versatile across applications that demand minimal training data.Architecture of CLIPCLIP consists of two main components:Image Encoder: CLIP uses a vision model (typically a ResNet or Vision Transformer) to generate image embeddings from raw image inputs.Text Encoder: A transformer-based model processes text and generates corresponding text embeddings.Both embeddings are then mapped into a shared latent space where the model can compute similarity scores between text and image representations, enabling it to classify images based on text descriptions.Harnessing CLIP for Zero-Shot Learning in Novel Class RecognitionHere's how to leverage the CLIP model for zero-shot learning in image classification.Step 1: Install Required LibrariesBefore you begin, ensure that the necessary Python libraries are installed. These include the transformers library, which provides access to the CLIP model, as well as torch and pillow for handling image data and deep learning operations.!pip install transformers torch pillowStep 2: Import LibrariesImport the necessary Python libraries. The transformers library provides the CLIP model and processor, while PIL (Pillow) is used for opening and manipulating images.from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModelfrom PIL import Imageimport torchStep 3: Load the Pre-trained CLIP ModelLoad a pre-trained instance of the CLIP model from OpenAI's model hub. This model has been trained on a variety of images and their descriptions, making it capable of generalizing from text to unseen visual content.model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")Step 4: Upload an ImageUpload an image to be classified. You can use a direct file path if you're working locally, or use a feature like Colab's upload feature if you're working in a notebook environment.image = Image.open(\"/content/dog.jpg\")Step 5: Define Class LabelsDefine a list of text descriptions that represent the classes you're interested in classifying. These labels are used by the CLIP model to compare against the image.labels = [\"a photo of a dog\", \"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a car\"]Step 6: Preprocess the InputsUse the CLIPProcessor to convert the image and text labels into a format suitable for the model, including any necessary padding and tensor transformations.inputs = processor(text=labels, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)Step 7: Perform Zero-Shot ClassificationPass the processed inputs to the CLIP model. The model outputs logits representing the similarity between the image and each label. These are then converted into probabilities to understand the model's confidence across the defined classes.outputs = model(**inputs)logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Similarity scoreprobs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)      # Probability distributionStep 8: Get the Predicted ClassDetermine the predicted class by finding the label with the highest probability. This step concludes the classification process, providing a zero-shot learning-based prediction.predicted_class = labels[probs.argmax()]print(f\"Predicted class: {predicted_class}\")Complete Code You can download the image of the dog from here.\nPython\n# Step 1: Install Required Libraries\n!pip install transformers torch pillow\n# Step 2: Import Libraries\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\n# Step 3: Load the Pre-trained CLIP Model\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\n# Step 4: Upload an Image (We used Colab's upload feature or provide a path)\nimage = Image.open(\"/content/dog.jpg\")\n# Step 5: Define Class Labels (Text descriptions)\nlabels = [\"a photo of a dog\", \"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a car\"]\n# Step 6: Preprocess the Inputs\ninputs = processor(text=labels, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\n# Step 7: Perform Zero-Shot Classification\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Similarity score\nprobs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)      # Probability distribution\n# Step 8: Get the Predicted Class\npredicted_class = labels[probs.argmax()]\nprint(f\"Predicted class: {predicted_class}\")\nOutput: Predicted class: a photo of a dogApplication of CLIP in Novel Class RecognitionZero-shot learning using CLIP can be highly impactful in various industries. Some notable applications include:Healthcare: In medical diagnostics, CLIP can identify rare diseases or conditions without needing large datasets of labeled medical images. By using descriptions of symptoms or conditions, it can recognize unseen medical images and assist in diagnosis.E-commerce: CLIP enables retailers to categorize new products based on textual descriptions alone, without the need for explicit training on every new product. This can streamline inventory management and recommendation systems.Autonomous Vehicles: CLIP’s ability to generalize to unseen objects can improve the safety of autonomous systems by allowing them to identify unfamiliar obstacles on the road.Content Moderation: With its zero-shot capabilities, CLIP can be employed in moderating user-generated content across platforms. By leveraging descriptions of inappropriate content, the model can flag potentially harmful images without prior training on explicit examples.Challenges and LimitationsWhile CLIP demonstrates powerful zero-shot capabilities, it’s not without its limitations:Bias and Fairness: Since CLIP is trained on large, web-crawled datasets, it can inherit biases present in the data. This may lead to biased classification or harmful outcomes in critical applications like healthcare or law enforcement.Contextual Misinterpretation: CLIP sometimes struggles with understanding nuanced contexts in images. For example, it may incorrectly associate an image with a textual description if the context isn't clear.Dependence on Textual Descriptions: The quality of CLIP’s predictions relies heavily on the richness and accuracy of the text descriptions provided. Poor or ambiguous descriptions may lead to inaccurate classifications.ConclusionZero-shot learning, enabled by models like CLIP, represents a revolutionary step forward in the field of machine learning. By leveraging both images and textual descriptions, CLIP allows for the recognition of unseen classes, eliminating the need for extensive labeled datasets and task-specific fine-tuning. The potential applications across industries are vast, from healthcare diagnostics to autonomous systems, but challenges like bias and contextual misinterpretation need to be addressed for widespread adoption. As we continue to refine models like CLIP, the future of zero-shot learning looks promising, opening up new possibilities for artificial intelligence in real-world applications.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nMulti-class classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)\nB\nbug8wdqo\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nSimilar Reads\nZero-Shot Text Classification using HuggingFace Model Zero-shot text classification is a groundbreaking technique that allows for categorizing text into predefined labels without any prior training on those specific labels.

This article explains an approach using the averaging filter, while this article provides one using a median filter. However, these convolutions often result in a loss of important edge information, since they blur out everything, irrespective of it being noise or an edge. To counter this problem, the non-linear bilateral filter was introduced.\nGaussian Blur\nGaussian blurring can be formulated as follows:\nHere, GA[I]_p  is the result at pixel p, and the RHS is essentially a sum over all pixels q weighted by the Gaussian function. I_q  is the intensity at pixel q.\nBilateral Filter: an Additional Edge Term\nThe bilateral filter can be formulated as follows:\nHere, the normalization factor and the range weight are new terms added to the previous equation. \\sigma_s  denotes the spatial extent of the kernel, i.e. the size of the neighborhood, and \\sigma_r  denotes the minimum amplitude of an edge. It ensures that only those pixels with intensity values similar to that of the central pixel are considered for blurring, while sharp intensity changes are maintained. The smaller the value of \\sigma_r  , the sharper the edge. As \\sigma_r  tends to infinity, the equation tends to a Gaussian blur.OpenCV has a function called bilateralFilter() with the following arguments:\nd: Diameter of each pixel neighborhood.sigmaColor: Value of \\sigma  in the color space. The greater the value, the colors farther to each other will start to get mixed.sigmaSpace: Value of \\sigma  in the coordinate space. The greater its value, the more further pixels will mix together, given that their colors lie within the sigmaColor range.\nCode : Input : Noisy Image.\nCode : Implementing Bilateral Filtering\nPython\nimport cv2\n# Read the image.\nimg = cv2.imread('taj.jpg')\n# Apply bilateral filter with d = 15,\n# sigmaColor = sigmaSpace = 75.\nbilateral = cv2.bilateralFilter(img, 15, 75, 75)\n# Save the output.\ncv2.imwrite('taj_bilateral.jpg', bilateral)\nOutput of Bilateral Filter\nComparison with Average and Median filters Below is the output of the average filter (cv2.blur(img, (5, 5))).\nBelow is the output of the median filter (cv2.medianBlur(img, 5)).\nBelow is the output of the Gaussian filter (cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 0)).\nIt is easy to note that all these denoising filters smudge the edges, while Bilateral Filtering retains them.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nImage Inpainting using OpenCV\nA\nAnannya Uberoi 1\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nPython\nImage-Processing\nOpenCV\nPython-OpenCV\nPractice Tags :\npython\nSimilar Reads\nOpenCV Tutorial in Python  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library.

Difference of Gaussian (DoG)Canny Edge DetectorConclusionEdge Detection - Frequently Asked QuestionsBasics of EdgeEdges can be defined as the points in an image where the intensity of pixels changes sharply. These changes often correspond to the physical boundaries of objects within the scene.Characteristics of Edges Gradient Magnitude: The edge strength is determined by the gradient magnitude, which measures the rate of change in intensity.Gradient Direction: The direction of the edge is perpendicular to the direction of the gradient, indicating the orientation of the boundary.Localization: Edges should be well-localized, meaning they should accurately correspond to the true boundaries in the image.Noise Sensitivity: Edges can be affected by noise, making it essential to use techniques that can distinguish between actual edges and noise.Types of EdgesEdges can be classified into several types based on their appearance and the way intensity changes occur:1. Step EdgesDefinition: A step edge is characterized by a sudden and significant change in intensity between two adjacent regions.Characteristics: These are the most common type of edges, representing clear boundaries between objects. In an ideal step edge, the transition is abrupt, though in real images, it might be affected by factors such as blurring and noise.2. Line EdgesDefinition: A line edge occurs where there is a transition in intensity that results in a thin line, typically surrounded by areas of different intensity.Characteristics: Line edges can be thought of as narrow regions where the intensity changes sharply but returns to its original value after a small distance. These edges are common in patterns and textures.3. Junction EdgesDefinition: Junction edges occur at the intersection of two or more edges, where multiple intensity transitions meet.Characteristics: These are complex edge points where different boundaries converge, forming T-junctions, Y-junctions, or other complex shapes. Junction edges are crucial for interpreting the structure and relationships between different objects in an image.Importance of Edge Detection in Computer Vision and Image ProcessingEdge detection plays a crucial role in various applications within computer vision and image processing:Object Recognition: By identifying the outlines of objects, edge detection helps in recognizing and classifying different objects within an image.Image Segmentation: It aids in dividing an image into meaningful regions, facilitating tasks such as object tracking and scene understanding.Feature Extraction: Edges provide essential features for further analysis, contributing to better accuracy in tasks like face recognition and medical imaging.Image Compression: By detecting and preserving edges, images can be compressed more efficiently without significant loss of important details.Edge Detection TechniquesEdge detection is a process used in image processing and computer vision to identify significant changes in brightness or color that typically correspond to the boundaries of objects within an image. This process simplifies the image, making it easier to analyze and interpret the shapes and structures present.The primary goal of edge detection is to capture the essential structural information in an image while reducing the amount of data to be processed. By focusing on the edges, the algorithms can highlight important features such as object outlines, textures, and patterns.Types of Edge DetectionEdge detection techniques can be broadly categorized based on the method they use to identify edges. Here are the main types:Gradient-Based MethodsSobel OperatorRoberts Cross OperatorPrewitt OperatorSecond-Order Derivative MethodsLaplacian of Gaussian (LoG)Difference of Gaussians (DoG)Optimal Edge DetectionCanny Edge DetectorMulti-Scale Edge DetectionWavelet TransformMachine Learning and Deep Learning-Based MethodsStructured ForestsConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)Gradient-Based Methods1. Sobel Operator The Sobel operator is a discrete differentiation operator that computes an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. It uses convolutional masks to highlight regions with high spatial frequency, which correspond to edges.The Sobel operator uses two 3x3 convolution masks, one for detecting changes in the horizontal direction (Gx) and one for the vertical direction (Gy).\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-2 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is then computed as:G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}}AdvantagesSimple and easy to implement.Provides good edge detection in images with noise due to the smoothing effect.DisadvantagesThe Sobel operator can be sensitive to noise.It may not perform well on edges that are not aligned with the grid of the masks.2. Prewitt OperatorThe Prewitt operator is similar to the Sobel operator but uses a different convolution mask. It also approximates the gradient of the image intensity function, focusing on edge detection.The Prewitt operator uses the following 3x3 convolution masks for horizontal (Gx) and vertical (Gy) edge detection:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is computed similarly:G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}}AdvantagesEasy to implement and computationally efficient.Performs well for detecting horizontal and vertical edges.DisadvantagesLike the Sobel operator, it can be sensitive to noise.May not be effective for detecting edges at angles other than 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°.3. Roberts Cross OperatorThe Roberts Cross operator is an early edge detection method that computes the gradient at a point in the image using the differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. It emphasizes edge detection along the diagonals.The Roberts Cross operator uses two 2x2 convolution masks for diagonal edge detection:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0  \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is then computed as:G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}}AdvantagesVery simple and easy to implement.Provides a high response to edges at 45° angles.DisadvantagesExtremely sensitive to noise due to the small size of the masks.Does not perform well on smooth or less noisy images.Limited accuracy for detecting edges not aligned with the masks.Laplacian-Based Methods1. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is a method used to detect edges in an image. It involves smoothing the image with a Gaussian filter to reduce noise, followed by applying the Laplacian operator to highlight regions of rapid intensity change. This combination allows for effective edge detection while minimizing the impact of noise.Mathematical FormulationGaussian Smoothing: The image is first smoothed using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise. The Gaussian filter is defined as: G(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2 } e^{\\frac{x^2 + y^2 }{2 \\sigma^2}}, \\sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian. Laplacian Operator: The Laplacian operator is then applied to the smoothed image. The Laplacian is defined as: \\nabla^ 2 f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}LoG: The combined LoG operator is the result of convolving the Gaussian-smoothed image with the Laplacian: LoG(x,y) = \\nabla^2 (G(x,y) * I(x,y))AdvantagesReduces noise through Gaussian smoothing before edge detection.Effective at detecting edges of various orientations and scales.DisadvantagesComputationally intensive due to the convolution operations.Sensitive to the choice of σ\\sigmaσ (standard deviation of the Gaussian).2. Difference of Gaussian (DoG)The Difference of Gaussian (DoG) is an edge detection technique that approximates the Laplacian of Gaussian by subtracting two Gaussian-blurred versions of the image with different standard deviations. This method is simpler and faster to compute than LoG while providing similar edge detection capabilities.Mathematical Formulation:Gaussian Smoothing: The image is smoothed using two Gaussian filters with different standard deviations, \\sigma_1 and \\sigma_2​: G_1 (x,y) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma_{1}^{2}} e^{\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\\sigma_{1}^{2}}}, \\quad G_2(x,y) =\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma_{2}^{2}} e^{\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\\sigma_{2}^{2}}} Difference of Gaussian: The DoG is computed by subtracting the two Gaussian-blurred images: DoG(x,y) = (G_{σ_1}(x,y)−G_{σ_2}(x,y))∗I(x,y)AdvantagesComputationally more efficient than LoG.Provides good edge detection by approximating the Laplacian of Gaussian.DisadvantagesLess accurate than LoG due to the approximation.Sensitive to the choice of the standard deviations (\\sigma_1​ and \\sigma_2) for the Gaussian filters.Canny Edge DetectorThe Canny Edge Detector is a multi-stage algorithm known for its accuracy and robustness in detecting edges. Introduced by John Canny in 1986, this method aims to find edges by looking for the local maxima of the gradient of the image. It optimizes the edge detection process based on three criteria: low error rate, good localization, and minimal response to noise.Steps Involved:Smoothing: The first step involves reducing noise in the image using a Gaussian filter: G(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2} e ^ {\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}. The image is convolved with this Gaussian kernel to produce a smoothed image.Finding Gradients: The gradients of the smoothed image are computed using finite difference approximations, typically with the Sobel operator:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-2 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is then computed as: G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}} , \\quad \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\frac{G_y}{G_x}. Non-Maximum Suppression: This step involves thinning the edges by suppressing non-maximum gradient values. Only the local maxima in the direction of the gradient are preserved, resulting in a set of thin edges.Double Thresholding: Two thresholds, T_{\\text{low }}  \\text{and }  T_{\\text{high}} ​, are applied to classify the gradient magnitudes into strong, weak, and non-relevant pixels:Strong edges: G \\geq T_{\\text{high}}Weak edges: T_{\\text{low}} \\leq G < T_{\\text{high}}Non-relevant pixels: G < T_{\\text{low}}Edge Tracking by Hysteresis: Weak edges connected to strong edges are preserved, while others are discarded. This step ensures continuity and accuracy in edge detection by linking weak edge pixels that form a continuous line with strong edges.AdvantagesHigh accuracy and robustness to noise.Good localization of edges.Produces thin, well-defined edges.DisadvantagesComputationally intensive due to multiple processing steps.Sensitive to the choice of thresholds for double thresholding.ConclusionEdge detection is a crucial technique in computer vision and image processing, essential for identifying object boundaries and simplifying image analysis. Different algorithms offer unique advantages and trade-offs, making it important to choose the right method for specific applications.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nImage Segmentation with Watershed Algorithm - OpenCV Python\nR\nrishu23454\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nBlogathon\nComputer Vision\nAI-ML-DS\nData Science Blogathon 2024\nSimilar Reads\nImage Processing Algorithms in Computer Vision In the field of computer vision, image preprocessing is a crucial step that involves transforming raw image data into a format that can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms.

This makes the model faster and more efficient.Translation Invariance: Pooling helps the network become invariant to small translations or distortions in the input image. For example, even if an object in an image is slightly shifted, the pooled output will remain relatively unchanged.Overfitting Prevention: By reducing the spatial dimensions, pooling layers help prevent overfitting by providing a form of regularization.Feature Hierarchy: Pooling layers help build a hierarchical representation of features, where lower layers capture fine details and higher layers capture more abstract and global features.Types of Pooling Layers1. Max PoolingMax pooling selects the maximum element from the region of the feature map covered by the filter. Thus, the output after max-pooling layer would be a feature map containing the most prominent features of the previous feature map. Max pooling layer preserves the most important features (edges, textures, etc.) and provides better performance in most cases.Max Pooling in Keras:\nPython\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import MaxPooling2D\nimport numpy as np\n# Example input feature map\nfeature_map = np.array([\n[1, 3, 2, 9],\n[5, 6, 1, 7],\n[4, 2, 8, 6],\n[3, 5, 7, 2]\n]).reshape(1, 4, 4, 1)\n# Applying max pooling\nmax_pool = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=2)\noutput = max_pool(feature_map)\nprint(output.numpy().reshape(2, 2))\nOutput: [[6 9] [5 8]]2. Average PoolingAverage pooling computes the average of the elements present in the region of feature map covered by the filter. Thus, while max pooling gives the most prominent feature in a particular patch of the feature map, average pooling gives the average of features present in a patch. Average pooling provides a more generalized representation of the input. It is useful in the cases where preserving the overall context is important. Average Pooling using Keras:\nPython\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import AveragePooling2D\nfeature_map = np.array([\n[1, 3, 2, 9],\n[5, 6, 1, 7],\n[4, 2, 8, 6],\n[3, 5, 7, 2]\n], dtype=np.float32).reshape(1, 4, 4, 1)  # Convert to float32\n# Applying average pooling\navg_pool = AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=2)\noutput = avg_pool(feature_map)\nprint(output.numpy().reshape(2, 2))\nOutput: [[3.75 4.75] [3.5  5.75]]3. Global PoolingGlobal pooling reduces each channel in the feature map to a single value, producing a 1 \\times 1 \\times n_c output. This is equivalent to applying a filter of size n_h × n_w. There are two types of global pooling:Global Max Pooling: Takes the maximum value across the entire feature map.Global Average Pooling: Computes the average of all values in the feature map.Global Pooling using Keras:\nPython\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalMaxPooling2D, GlobalAveragePooling2D\nfeature_map = np.array([\n[1, 3, 2, 9],\n[5, 6, 1, 7],\n[4, 2, 8, 6],\n[3, 5, 7, 2]\n], dtype=np.float32).reshape(1, 4, 4, 1)\n# Applying global max pooling\ngm_pool = GlobalMaxPooling2D()\ngm_output = gm_pool(feature_map)\n# Applying global average pooling\nga_pool = GlobalAveragePooling2D()\nga_output = ga_pool(feature_map)\nprint(\"Global Max Pooling Output:\", gm_output.numpy())\nprint(\"Global Average Pooling Output:\", ga_output.numpy())\nOutput:  Global Max Pooling Output: [[9]]Global Average Pooling Output: [[4.4375]]How Pooling Layers Work?Define a Pooling Window (Filter): The size of the pooling window (e.g., 2x2) is chosen, along with a stride (the step size by which the window moves). A common choice is a 2x2 window with a stride of 2, which reduces the feature map size by half.Slide the Window Over the Input: The pooling operation is applied to each region of the input feature map covered by the window.Apply the Pooling Operation: Depending on the type of pooling (max, average, etc.), the operation extracts the required value from each window.Output the Downsampled Feature Map: The result is a smaller feature map that retains the most important information.Key Factors to Consider for Optimizing Pooling Layer Pooling Window Size: The size of the pooling window affects the degree of downsampling. A larger window results in more aggressive downsampling but may lose important details.Stride: The stride determines how much the pooling window moves at each step. A larger stride results in greater dimensionality reduction.Padding: In some cases, padding is used to ensure that the pooling operation covers the entire input feature map.Advantages of Pooling LayerDimensionality reduction: Pooling layer helps in reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This reduces the computational cost and also helps in avoiding overfitting by reducing the number of parameters in the model.Translation invariance: Pooling layers are useful in achieving translation invariance in the feature maps. This means that the position of an object in the image does not affect the classification result, as the same features are detected regardless of the position of the object.Feature selection: Pooling layers help in selecting the most important features from the input, as max pooling selects the most salient features and average pooling provides a balanced representation. Disadvantages of Pooling LayersInformation Loss: Pooling reduces spatial resolution, which can lead to a loss of important fine details.Over-smoothing: Excessive pooling may blur out crucial features.Hyperparameter Tuning: The choice of pooling size and stride affects performance and requires careful tuning.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nCIFAR-10 Image Classification in TensorFlow\nS\nsavyakhosla\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nNeural Network\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nSimilar Reads\nDeep Learning Tutorial  Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to learn from large datasets using multi-layered neural networks.

It’s used in machine learning for tasks like classification and prediction. In this article, we’ll see more about Decision Trees, their types and other core concepts.A Decision Tree helps us make decisions by showing different options and how they are related. It has a tree-like structure that starts with one main question called the root node which represents the entire dataset. From there, the tree branches out into different possibilities based on features in the data.Root Node: Starting point representing the whole dataset.Branches: Lines connecting nodes showing the flow from one decision to another.Internal Nodes: Points where decisions are made based on data features.Leaf Nodes: End points of the tree where the final decision or prediction is made.Decision TreeA Decision Tree also helps with decision-making by showing possible outcomes clearly. By looking at the \"branches\" we can quickly compare options and figure out the best choice.There are mainly two types of Decision Trees based on the target variable:Classification Trees: Used for predicting categorical outcomes like spam or not spam. These trees split the data based on features to classify data into predefined categories.Regression Trees: Used for predicting continuous outcomes like predicting house prices. Instead of assigning categories, it provides numerical predictions based on the input features.How Decision Trees Work?1. Start with the Root Node: It begins with a main question at the root node which is derived from the dataset’s features.2. Ask Yes/No Questions: From the root, the tree asks a series of yes/no questions to split the data into subsets based on specific attributes.3. Branching Based on Answers: Each question leads to different branches:If the answer is yes, the tree follows one path.If the answer is no, the tree follows another path.4. Continue Splitting: This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step.5. Reach the Leaf Node: The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made.Let’s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time:1. In the morning: It asks “Tired?”If yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee.If no, it says no coffee is needed.2. In the afternoon: It asks again “Tired?”If yes, it suggests drinking coffee.If no, no coffee is needed.ExampleSplitting Criteria in Decision TreesIn a Decision Tree, the process of splitting data at each node is important. The splitting criteria finds the best feature to split the data on. Common splitting criteria include Gini Impurity and Entropy.Gini Impurity: This criterion measures how \"impure\" a node is. The lower the Gini Impurity the better the feature splits the data into distinct categories.Entropy: This measures the amount of uncertainty or disorder in the data. The tree tries to reduce the entropy by splitting the data on features that provide the most information about the target variable.These criteria help decide which features are useful for making the best split at each decision point in the tree.Pruning in Decision TreesPruning is an important technique used to prevent overfitting in Decision Trees. Overfitting occurs when a tree becomes too deep and starts to memorize the training data rather than learning general patterns. This leads to poor performance on new, unseen data.This technique reduces the complexity of the tree by removing branches that have little predictive power. It improves model performance by helping the tree generalize better to new data. It also makes the model simpler and faster to deploy.It is useful when a Decision Tree is too deep and starts to capture noise in the data.Advantages of Decision TreesEasy to Understand: Decision Trees are visual which makes it easy to follow the decision-making process.Versatility: Can be used for both classification and regression problems.No Need for Feature Scaling: Unlike many machine learning models, it don’t require us to scale or normalize our data.Handles Non-linear Relationships: It capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and outcomes effectively.Interpretability: The tree structure is easy to interpret helps in allowing users to understand the reasoning behind each decision.Handles Missing Data: It can handle missing values by using strategies like assigning the most common value or ignoring missing data during splits.Disadvantages of Decision TreesOverfitting: They can overfit the training data if they are too deep which means they memorize the data instead of learning general patterns. This leads to poor performance on unseen data.Instability: It can be unstable which means that small changes in the data may lead to significant differences in the tree structure and predictions.Bias towards Features with Many Categories: It can become biased toward features with many distinct values which focuses too much on them and potentially missing other important features which can reduce prediction accuracy.Difficulty in Capturing Complex Interactions: Decision Trees may struggle to capture complex interactions between features which helps in making them less effective for certain types of data.Computationally Expensive for Large Datasets: For large datasets, building and pruning a Decision Tree can be computationally intensive, especially as the tree depth increases.Applications of Decision TreesDecision Trees are used across various fields due to their simplicity, interpretability and versatility lets see some key applications:Loan Approval in Banking: Banks use Decision Trees to assess whether a loan application should be approved. The decision is based on factors like credit score, income, employment status and loan history. This helps predict approval or rejection helps in enabling quick and reliable decisions.Medical Diagnosis: In healthcare they assist in diagnosing diseases. For example, they can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on clinical data like glucose levels, BMI and blood pressure. This helps classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories, supporting early diagnosis and treatment.Predicting Exam Results in Education: Educational institutions use  to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on factors like attendance, study time and past grades. This helps teachers identify at-risk students and offer targeted support.Customer Churn Prediction: Companies use Decision Trees to predict whether a customer will leave or stay based on behavior patterns, purchase history, and interactions. This allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers.Fraud Detection: In finance, Decision Trees are used to detect fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud. By analyzing past transaction data and patterns, Decision Trees can identify suspicious activities and flag them for further investigation.A decision tree can also be used to help build automated predictive models which have applications in machine learning, data mining and statistics. By mastering Decision Trees, we can gain a deeper understanding of data and make more informed decisions across different fields.If you want to learn that refer to related article:Python | Decision tree implementation How To Build Decision Tree in MATLAB?\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nDecision Tree Classifiers in R Programming\nS\nsaloni1297\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learning\nSimilar Reads\nDecision Theory in AI Decision theory is a foundational concept in Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling machines to make rational and informed decisions based on available data.

This article offers concise yet comprehensive advantages of these algorithms from their foundational principles to practical applications. Let's uncover the strategies that drive intelligent gameplay in adversarial environments. Table of Content\nWhat is an Adversarial search?Adversarial search algorithmsMinimax algorithmAlpha-beta pruningAdversarial search algorithm Implementations using Connect-4 GameApplications of adversarial search algorithmsConclusionFAQ’s on Adversarial search algorithmsWhat is an Adversarial search?The Adversarial search is a well-suited approach in a competitive environment, where two or more agents have conflicting goals.  The adversarial search can be employed in two-player zero-sum games which means what is good for one player will be the misfortune for the other. In such a case, there is no win-win outcome. In artificial intelligence, adversarial search plays a vital role in decision-making, particularly in competitive environments associated with games and strategic interactions. By employing adversarial search, AI agents can make optimal decisions while anticipating the actions of an opponent with their opposing objectives. It aims to establish an effective decision for a player by considering the possible moves and the counter-moves of the opponents. The adversarial search in competitive environments can be utilized in the below scenarios where the AI system can assist in determining the best course of action by both considering the possible moves and counter-moves of the opponents. Each agent seeks to boost their utility or minimize their loss. One agent’s action impacts the outcomes and objectives of the other agents. Additionally, strategic uncertainty arises when the agents may lack sufficient information about each other’s strategies. Role of Adversarial Search in AIGame-playing: The Adversarial search finds a significant application in game-playing scenarios, including renowned games like chess, Go, and poker. The adversarial search offers the simplified nature of these games that represents the state of a game in a straightforward approach and the agents are limited to a small number of actions whose effects are governed by precise rules. Decision-making: Decision-making plays a central role in adversarial search algorithms, where the goal is to find the best possible move or strategy for a player in a competitive environment against one or more components. This requires strategic thinking, evaluation of potential outcomes, and adaptive decision-making throughout the game.  Adversarial search algorithmsThe search algorithms like DFS, BFS, and A* can be well-suited for single-agent environments where there is no direct competition or conflict between multiple agents. These algorithms are suitable for finding an optimal solution in such scenarios. On the other hand, in zero-sum games where two players compete directly against each other, adversarial search algorithms like Minmax and Alpha-Beta pruning are more appropriate since these algorithms can determine the best course of action for each player in zero-sum games. Minimax algorithmThe Minimax algorithm is claimed to be a recursive or backtracking algorithm that is responsible for choosing the best optimal move in the conflicting environment. The Minimax algorithm operates on a tree structure known as the game tree, which is the collection of all the possible moves in the corresponding game  states in a given game.  The game tree’s leaf node accommodates all the possible moves. The game state denotes the current board condition. With every single move, the game state changes and the game tree gets updated height-wise. When visualized, this game tree often resembles an inverted tree, with the root representing the current game state and the branches representing possible moves.This algorithm simply works by proceeding down to the tree until it reaches the leaf node and then it backs up the minimax values through the tree as the recursion unwinds. The prime motive of the Minimax algorithm is to maximize the chance of winning for the maximizer. In the game tree, every node is assigned weights that influence the chances of winning, the higher the weights, the higher the chances of winning. Key terminologies in the Minimax algorithmMinimax Tree: A tree structure shows all possible moves and game states in a game, used by Minimax to find the best move.MAX (Maximizer) - Maximizer seeks favorable outcomes in games by maximizing chances of winning for themselves as players.MIN (Minimizer) - Minimizer reduces winning chances, making moves leading to least favorable outcome for the Maximizer in games.Initial state - Starting state of game board, representing the configuration at the beginning of the game.Terminal state -Terminal states are the final outcomes of a game board, resulting in either a win, loss, or draw.Heuristic Evaluation Function: Function evaluates game states for maximizer, assigning numerical values to each game state based on piece positions, material advantage, and board control.How Minimax search algorithm help in finding the optimal strategy?Terminal state: The Minimax value of each state in the game tree can be used to determine the optimal strategy. The MINIMAX(s) refers to the utility of being in that state that assumes both players play optimally from there to the end of the game. Non-terminal state: In the case of the non-terminal state, when MAX's turn arrives at the game, MAX aims to move which leads to a state of maximum value, conversely MIN prefers to choose the move that leads to a state of minimum value. It can be formulated as below:\\begin{aligned}\nMINIMAX(S) = \\begin{cases}\n&UTILITY(s, \\text{MAX}) \\rightarrow \\text{if } IS\\_TERMINAL(s), \\\\\n&\\max_{a \\in Actions(s)} \\text{ } MINIMAX(RESULT(s,a)) \\rightarrow \\text{if } TO\\_MOVE(s) = \\text{MAX}, \\\\\n&\\min_{a \\in Actions(s)} \\text{ } MINIMAX(RESULT(s,a)) \\rightarrow \\text{if } TO\\_MOVE(s) = \\text{MIN}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\nPseudocode for Minimax algorithmThe Pseudocode for the Minimax algorithm is given below:MINIMAX(node, depth, maximizingPlayer): This function recursively evaluates the minimax value of each node in the game tree. It alternated between maximizing and minimizing player nodes based on the maximizingPlayer parameterMINIMAX(node, depth, maximizingPlayer):    if depth is 0 or node is a terminal node:        return the heuristic value of node    if maximizingPlayer:        bestValue = -INFINITY        for each child of node:            value = MINIMAX(child, depth - 1, FALSE)            bestValue = max(bestValue, value)        return bestValue    else:        bestValue = +INFINITY        for each child of node:            value = MINIMAX(child, depth - 1, TRUE)            bestValue = min(bestValue, value)        return bestValuefindBestMove(board): This function is responsible for iterating through all possible moves on the board and evaluates each moves using minimax algorithm. Then it returns the moves with the highest minimax value for the maximizing player. findBestMove(board):    bestValue = -INFINITY    bestMove = NULL    for each possible move in board:        if move is valid:            make the move on the board            value = MINIMAX(board, depth, FALSE)            undo the move on the board            if value > bestValue:                bestValue = value                bestMove = move    return bestMoveUnderstanding the Minimax algorithm: Decision-making in game treesThe minimax algorithm is a backtracking algorithm that recursively tries different possibilities and backtracks when the solution is not found. In the context of the Minimax algorithm, this involves exploring all possible moves in the game tree that evaluate each potential outcome and making decisions based on the evaluations. The diagram below represents the binary tree that holds the possible game states and moves in a game, with each leaf node representing a final game state. figure(a) Example of Minimax algorithm that holds the possible game statesMaximizer and MinimizerIn the Minimax algorithm, there are two players such as the maximizer and the minimizer. The maximizer aims to maximize its score (e.g., by winning the game), conversely, the minimizer aims to minimize the maximizer’s score (e.g., by preventing the maximizer from winning).Example of decision-makingInitial decision-making: An example scenario in Figure (a) within the perfect binary tree causes the maximizer to make the first move at the root. The maximizer has the option to choose to traverse through the tree, in this case, it needs to choose the path between left or right. Minimizer’s choice: Assuming that maximizer traverses to the left where it reaches the minimizer node, the minimizer has the responsibility of selecting the optimal value and it chooses between two values (2 and 5). The objective of the minimizer is to minimize the maximizer's score, so it chooses the lowest value 2. The value 2 is then passed to the root node so that it can be compared later when the player earns an optimal value when he traverses to the right side of the game tree. Figure (b) Minimizer's choiceTraversal to the Right: The maximizer then traverses to the right side of the game tree and encounters another set of decision nodes. Eventually, it reaches another minimizer node where the minimizer again selects the optimal minimal value 1 among its options.Figure (c) The maximizer traversing through the rightRecursive process: The process continues recursively where each player makes decisions based on whether they are maximizer or minimizer and the objective of maximizing or minimizing the score respectively. Comparison and outcome: The maximizer node (root node) already holds the value of 2, when the player earns another optimal value that is 1 while traversing in the right path, it is then compared to get the final optimal value.  The maximizer earns the optimal value 2 based on the decisions made by both players. Final outcome of binary game treeTime and Space complexity of Minimax algorithm Time complexityThe minimax algorithm explores the complete game tree using a depth-first search approach that considers all possible moves at each level. The time complexity of the minimax algorithm can be written as,                                          O(bm)b - denotes the legal moves available at each point,m - denotes the maximum depth of the tree.This complexity arises because, at each level of the tree, the minimax algorithm must consider all b legal moves and this process repeats recursively for m levels until a terminal state is reached. Space complexityThe space complexity of the minimax algorithm relies on how the algorithm generates and stores the actions. In the case, where if all the possible actions are generated and stored simultaneously, the space complexity can be written as                                             O(bm)b - denotes the legal moves available at each point,m - denotes the maximum depth of the tree.This arises because the algorithm needs to store all the possible actions at each level of the game tree which leads to exponential growth in space requirements with the depth of the tree. However, if the actions are generated and processed one at a time, the space complexity reduces to O(m).Alpha-beta pruningAlpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for a minimax algorithm. It reduces computation time by a huge factor, allowing the user to traverse faster and deeper into the tree. It stops evaluating when at least one possibility has been found that typically proves the move to be worse than the previously examined move. The minimax search is based on depth-first search which considers the nodes along a single path in a tree. But Alph-Beta pruning bonds with two major parameters in MAX-VALUE(state, alpha, beta), representing Alpha plays a maximizer role, whereas Beta plays a minimizer role. Alpha - denotes the value of the best or highest value.Beta - denotes the value of the best or lowest value. Why Alpha-beta pruning is considered as an effective algorithm in the adversarial search? Branch elimination: The Alpha-beta pruning algorithm relies on the branches of the game tree that can be eliminated which promotes the more promising subtree by limiting the search time. Branch and bound: Alpha-beta pruning is based on the branch and bound method which offers a way to solve the optimization problem by dividing them into sub-problems. It allows the algorithm to effectively remove the branches that did not yield the optimal solution.Heuristic improvements: To limit the computation time, the heuristic Alpha-beta tree search cuts off the search early and applies the heuristic evaluation function to states that treat the non-terminal nodes as if they were terminal nodes. Pseudocode for Alpha-beta pruningThe Pseudocode for Alpha-beta pruning is given belowfunction ALPHA-BETA(node, depth, alpha, beta, maximizingPlayer):    if depth == 0 or node is a terminal node:        return the heuristic value of node    if maximizingPlayer:        for each child of node:            alpha = max(alpha, ALPHA-BETA(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, FALSE))            if beta <= alpha:                break   // Beta cut-off        return alpha    else:        for each child of node:            beta = min(beta, ALPHA-BETA(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, TRUE))            if beta <= alpha:                break   // Alpha cut-off        return betaUnderstanding the Alpha-beta pruning: Decision-making in game treesGame trees can hold abounding branches that can lead to different game states and implementing alpha-beta pruning in such game trees can help to prune away the branches if there already exists a better move. This makes the algorithm computationally efficient since there is no need to search the other branches if there already exists a better move in the game tree. At any node in the game tree, the maximizing player is used to store the maximum score in the alpha which assures that the max node contains only the maximum scores. Similarly, the minimizing player is assured of a minimum value which is stored by the beta. These two values of alpha and beta are updated and maintained by the algorithm.Take a look at the below example, initially both players begin with the worst possible values they can score, therefore the alpha is assigned with the value of minus infinity, whereas the beta is assigned with the value of plus infinity. We have a condition to prune the branches, if the alpha is greater than or equal to the beta value then we can prune the branch. Note: alpha is the maximizer and beta is the minimizer.Initially, the maximizer node A sets alpha to negative infinity and beta to positive infinity. Assuming that node A selects node B which inherits these values. Node B which is also a maximizer picks node D. At D, the maximizer chooses the max value (4) and then updates its alpha. Upon returning to B (minimizer), it compares its current beta with D’s alpha value. If D’s alpha is smaller, B’s beta value gets updated. In our example, B’s beta gets updated since D’s alpha value is smaller. Initial game stateNow, node B selects node E and passes down its current alpha and beta values to node E. Node E inherits the alpha value of negative infinity and beta value of 4. As a maximizer, E explores its left leaf node that holds a value of 5. Since 5 is greater than negative infinity, E’s alpha gets updated. Given that alpha is greater than beta, the other leaf node in E is unnecessary to explore so it gets pruned.values of B and D were foundAt node B, it compares its beta value with node E’s alpha, if E’s alpha value is lesser than B’s beta updates with E’s alpha. However, if E’s alpha is greater than B’s beta, B’s beta remains unchanged. In our example, since B’s beta is not greater than E’s alpha, so B’s beta value remains the same. Returning to node A, its alpha value updates with B’s beta value because B’s beta is greater than A’s alpha.The maximizer yields the value 4At node A, the maximizer’s alpha becomes 4 ensuring a value of 4 or higher. A then explores its right child which is node R. At C, alpha is 4 and beta is positive infinity. C then chooses its left child F. Node F inherits the alpha value 4 and beta value positive infinity from the parent node. F’s left child yields 0 updating the F’s alpha to 4 and also F’s right child yields 1. Although F can achieve 1, alpha remains 4. C receives 1 from F which makes the beta 1. As alpha is greater than beta, the entire subtree of node G gets pruned. This pruning logic ensures that, as C is guaranteed 1 or less, it’s irrational for A to choose C over B, where A is already guaranteed 4. The Maximizer still holds the max value 4 and  branch G gets pruned.Adversarial search algorithm Implementations using Connect-4 GameConnect-4 is a game played between two players who take turns dropping discs of their chosen color into a vertically suspended grid with seven columns and six rows. The objective is to be the first to form a line of four of one’s discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally is considered a win. The game is considered solved when a player can always win or is forced to draw. This implies that there exists an optimal strategy for both players ensuring that the outcome of the game can be determined in advance. The Connect-4 game is said to be a zero-sum game because the advantage of one player will be the disadvantage of its opponent. In this example, we will be using the Minimax algorithm to find the optimal strategy in the connect-4 game. Take a look at the below illustration, The player X chose the color red and the player O chose the color blue. In the below environment, it's now player O's turn to make a move. We will implement a minimax algorithm to find the optimal strategy for player O.Connect-4 game where the player O should make the optimal move to win the gameImplementation of Connect-4 using Minimax algorithmStep 1: Check if there are any moves leftis_moves_left: This function checks if there are any empty cells left on the game board. If there are any empty cells left, it returns the value True which indicates that there are moves left to be made. Otherwise, it returns False indicating that the game board is full and no moves can be made.\nPython\ndef is_moves_left(board):\nfor row in board:\nfor cell in row:\nif cell == '':\nreturn True\nreturn False\nStep 2: Evaluate the boardevaluate: We define this function to evaluate the current state of the game board and it returns a score based on whether there is a winning configuration for a player O such as horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If there is a winning configuration it returns a score of 10, otherwise it returns 0.\nPython\ndef evaluate(b):\nfor row in range(6):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row][col+1] == b[row][col+2] == b[row][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col] == b[row+2][col] == b[row+3][col] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col+1] == b[row+2][col+2] == b[row+3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3, 6):\nfor col in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row - 1][col+1] == b[row-2][col+2] == b[row - 3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nreturn 0\nStep 3: Implement the Minimax algorithmminimax: We define the minimax function to implement the minimax algorithm that makes decision-making simpler in two-player games. It recursively evaluates the possible moves and returns the best score for the current player.\nPython\ndef minimax(board, depth, is_max):\nscore = evaluate(board)\nif score == 10:\nreturn score - depth\nif not is_moves_left(board):\nreturn 0\nif is_max:\nbest_value = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'x'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\nelse:\nbest_value = float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\nStep 4: Find the optimal move for player Ofind_optimal_move: We define this function to discover the optimal move for player O by simulating all possible moves and evaluating their scores using the minimax algorithm. It returns the coordinates of the best move.\nPython\ndef find_optimal_move(board):\nbest_move = None\nbest_val = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nmove_val = minimax(board, 0, False)\nboard[row][col] = ''\nif move_val > best_val:\nbest_val = move_val\nbest_move = (row, col)\nbreak\nreturn best_move\nStep 5: Test the given board configurationHere, we will test the given board configuration and print out the optimal move for player O to win a game. If there is no possible winning move, it prints a message indicating that player O cannot win with the current board configuration.\nPython\nboard = [\n['x', 'x', 'o', '', '', '', 'x'],\n['o', 'o', 'o', 'x', '', '', 'x'],\n['x', 'o', '', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'o', 'o', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'x', 'x', 'o', '', '', ''],\n['o', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', '', '']\n]\noptimal_move = find_optimal_move(board)\nif optimal_move:\nprint(\"The optimal move for player O to win is:\", optimal_move)\nelse:\nprint(\"Player O cannot win with the current board confguration\")\nComplete code\nPython\ndef is_moves_left(board):\nfor row in board:\nfor cell in row:\nif cell == '':\nreturn True\nreturn False\ndef evaluate(b):\nfor row in range(6):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row][col+1] == b[row][col+2] == b[row][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col] == b[row+2][col] == b[row+3][col] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col+1] == b[row+2][col+2] == b[row+3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3, 6):\nfor col in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row - 1][col+1] == b[row-2][col+2] == b[row - 3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nreturn 0\ndef minimax(board, depth, is_max):\nscore = evaluate(board)\nif score == 10:\nreturn score - depth\nif not is_moves_left(board):\nreturn 0\nif is_max:\nbest_value = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'x'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\nelse:\nbest_value = float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\ndef find_optimal_move(board):\nbest_move = None\nbest_val = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nmove_val = minimax(board, 0, False)\nboard[row][col] = ''\nif move_val > best_val:\nbest_val = move_val\nbest_move = (row, col)\nbreak\nreturn best_move\nboard = [\n['x', 'x', 'o', '', '', '', 'x'],\n['o', 'o', 'o', 'x', '', '', 'x'],\n['x', 'o', '', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'o', 'o', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'x', 'x', 'o', '', '', ''],\n['o', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', '', '']\n]\noptimal_move = find_optimal_move(board)\nif optimal_move:\nprint(\"The optimal move for player O to win is:\", optimal_move)\nelse:\nprint(\"Player O cannot win with the current board confguration\")\nOutput:The optimal move for player O to win is: (2,2)Output ExplanationOutput of Connect-4 where the player O winsTake a look at the above output illustration, the player O won when he chose the optimal move such as (2,2). It's important to note that there are multiple possible moves that player O could have made to potentially win the game. However, in the given illustration only seven states of the game board are shown to demonstrate the process of finding the optimal move using the minimax algorithm.Applications of adversarial search algorithmsBoard games: Adversarial search is most widely used in various board games like Chess, Checkers, Go and Connect Four.

This technology has been developed over the years and has become increasingly sophisticated, with the ability to produce accurate translations across a wide range of languages. The article explores more about machine translation, why we need it and its applications.\nTable of Content\nWhat is Machine Translation?What are the key approaches in Machine Translation?Why we need Machine Translation in NLP?What is the application of Machine Translation?Can Human Translators be replaced by AI?What is Machine Translation?Machine translation is a sub-field of computational linguistics that focuses on developing systems capable of automatically translating text or speech from one language to another. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the goal of machine translation is to produce translations that are not only grammatically correct but also convey the meaning of the original content accurately.\nMachine Translation Model History of Machine Translation The automatic translation of text from one natural language (the source) to another is known as machine translation (the target). It was one of the first applications for computers that were imagined (Weaver, 1949).\nThere have been three primary uses of machine translation in the past:\nRough translation, such as that given by free internet services, conveys the \"gist\" of a foreign statement or document but is riddled with inaccuracies. Companies utilize pre-edited translation to publish documentation and sales materials in several languages.The original source content is written in a limited language that makes machine translation easier, and the outputs are often edited by a person to rectify any flaws.Restricted-source translation is totally automated, but only for highly stereotyped language like a weather report.What are the key approaches in Machine Translation?In machine translation, the original text is decoded and then encoded into the target language through two step process that involves various approaches employed by language translation technology to facilitate the translation mechanism.\n1. Rule-Based Machine Translation Rule-based machine translation relies on these resources to ensure precise translation of specific content. The process involves the software parsing input text, generating a transitional representation, and then converting it into the target language with reference to grammar rules and dictionaries.\n2. Statistical Machine Translation Rather than depending on linguistic rules, statistical machine translation utilizes machine learning for text translation. Machine learning algorithms examine extensive human translations, identifying statistical patterns. When tasked with translating a new source text, the software intelligently guesses based on the statistical likelihood of specific words or phrases being associated with others in the target language.\n3. Neural Machine Translation (NMT)A neural network, inspired by the human brain, is a network of interconnected nodes functioning as an information system. Input data passes through these nodes to produce an output. Neural machine translation software utilizes neural networks to process vast datasets, with each node contributing a specific change from source text to target text until the final result is obtained at the output node.\n4. Hybrid Machine Translation Hybrid machine translation tools integrate multiple machine translation models within a single software application, leveraging a combination of approaches to enhance the overall effectiveness of a singular translation model. This process typically involves the incorporation of rule-based and statistical machine translation subsystems, with the ultimate translation output being a synthesis of the results generated by each subsystem.\nWhy we need Machine Translation in NLP?Machine translation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has several benefits, including:\nImproved communication: Machine translation makes it easier for people who speak different languages to communicate with each other, breaking down language barriers and facilitating international cooperation.Cost savings: Machine translation is typically faster and less expensive than human translation, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses and organizations that need to translate large amounts of text.Increased accessibility: Machine translation can make digital content more accessible to users who speak different languages, improving the user experience and expanding the reach of digital products and services.Improved efficiency: Machine translation can streamline the translation process, allowing businesses and organizations to quickly translate large amounts of text and improving overall efficiency.Language learning: Machine translation can be a valuable tool for language learners, helping them to understand the meaning of unfamiliar words and phrases and improving their language skills.What is the application of Machine Translation?Machine translation has many applications, including:\nCross-border communication: Machine translation allows people from different countries to communicate with each other more easily, breaking down language barriers and facilitating international cooperation.Localization: Machine translation can be used to quickly and efficiently translate websites, software, and other digital content into different languages, making them more accessible to users around the world.Business: Machine translation can be used by businesses to translate documents, contracts, and other important materials, enabling them to work with partners and customers from around the world.Education: Machine translation can be used in education to help students learn new languages and improve their language skills.Government: Machine translation can be used by governments to translate official documents and communications, improving accessibility and transparency.Can Human Translators be replaced by AI?Challenges arise as different languages categorize and express concepts in diverse ways, demanding careful consideration in translation. The use of an interlingua, a representation language capturing distinctions among languages, becomes essential. Whether undertaken by humans or machines, effective translation involves grasping the entirety of the scenario presented in the source, not just individual words. Complexities further intensify when dealing with cultural and grammatical nuances, underscoring the intricacies of the translation endeavor.\nIt can be challenging for translators (both machine and human) to make this decision. \"The baseball struck the window,\" for example, maybe translated as \"The baseball hit the window.\" In order to translate \"it broke\" into French, we must pick between the feminine \"elle\" and the masculine \"il,\" indicating whether \"it\" refers to the baseball or the window. To get the translation properly, you'll need to know both physics and language.\nWhile AI and machine translation systems continue to improve, the goal should be seen as augmentation rather than replacement. Many applications benefit from a collaborative approach where AI tools assist human translators in their work, improving efficiency and consistency. The human touch remains crucial for nuanced, accurate, and culturally sensitive translations.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nRational Agent in AI\nM\nmohit gupta_omg :)\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nNLP\nArtificial Intelligence\nSimilar Reads\nReasoning Mechanisms in AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are designed to mimic human intelligence and decision-making processes, and reasoning is a critical component of these capabilities.

This is essential for autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots operating in unstructured spaces. Visual serving: AI allows robots to track and precisely manipulate objects based on visual feedback, crucial for tasks like welding, painting, or assembling delicate components.AI algorithms process camera and sensor data to map surroundings, identify obstacles, and plan safe and efficient paths for robots to navigate.Natural Language Processing (NLP)Human-robot interaction: Robots can understand and respond to natural language commands, enabling more intuitive and collaborative interactions with humans.Voice control: Robots can be controlled through voice commands, making them accessible for a wider range of users.Sentiment analysis: AI can analyze human text and speech to understand emotions and adjust robot behavior accordingly.Machine LearningAutonomous decision-making: AI algorithms can learn from data and make decisions in real-time, enabling robots to adapt to changing environments and react to unexpected situations.Reinforcement learning: Robots can learn motor skills and control strategies through trial and error, allowing them to perform complex tasks like walking, running, or playing games.Predictive maintenance: AI can analyze sensor data to predict equipment failures and schedule preventive maintenance, reducing downtime and costs.How do Robots and Artificial Intelligence work together?The answer is simple. An artificial intelligence robot, or AI robot, gives robots a computer vision to navigate, sense, and calculate their reactions accordingly. Artificial intelligence robots learn to perform their tasks from humans through machine learning, which is a part of computer programming and AI. Since the time self-driving cars coined the term Artificial Intelligence in 1956, it has created a lot of sensation. This is because an artificial intelligence robot has the power to give life to robots and empower them to take their decisions on their own. Depending on the use and the tasks that the robot has to perform, different types of AI are used. They are as follows:1. Weak AIWeak AI, also known as Narrow AI is a type of AI is used to create a simulation of human thought and interaction. The robots have predefined commands and responses. However, the robots do not understand the commands they do only the work of retrieving the appropriate response when the suitable command is given. The most suitable example of this is Siri and Alexa.The AI in these devices only executes the tasks as demanded by the owner.2. Strong Artificial IntelligenceStrong Artificial Intelligence is a type of AI is used in those robots who perform their tasks on their own. They do not need any kind of supervision once they are programmed to do the task correctly. This type of AI is widely used nowadays as many of the things are becoming automated and one of the most interesting examples is self-driving cars and internet carsThis type of AI is also used in humanoid robots, which can sense their environment quite well and interact with their surroundings. Also, robotic surgeons are becoming popular day by day as there is no human intervention required at all.3. Specialized Artificial IntelligenceSpecialized artificial intelligence is used when the robot needs to perform only specified special tasks. It is restricted only to limited tasks. This includes mainly industrial robots which perform specified and repetitive tasks like painting, tightening, etc.Benefits of AI in Robotics Benefits of AI in RoboticsAI has already been adopted in robotics, establishing a new generation of intelligent robots that can go farther.

Originating in 2018, this framework was crafted by researchers from Google AI Language. The article aims to explore the architecture, working and applications of BERT.What is BERT?BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) leverages a transformer-based neural network to understand and generate human-like language. BERT employs an encoder-only architecture. In the original Transformer architecture, there are both encoder and decoder modules. The decision to use an encoder-only architecture in BERT suggests a primary emphasis on understanding input sequences rather than generating output sequences.Bidirectional Approach of BERTTraditional language models process text sequentially, either from left to right or right to left. This method limits the model's awareness to the immediate context preceding the target word. BERT uses a bi-directional approach considering both the left and right context of words in a sentence, instead of analyzing the text sequentially, BERT looks at all the words in a sentence simultaneously.Example: \"The bank is situated on the _______ of the river.\"In a unidirectional model, the understanding of the blank would heavily depend on the preceding words, and the model might struggle to discern whether \"bank\" refers to a financial institution or the side of the river.BERT, being bidirectional, simultaneously considers both the left (\"The bank is situated on the\") and right context (\"of the river\"), enabling a more nuanced understanding. It comprehends that the missing word is likely related to the geographical location of the bank, demonstrating the contextual richness that the bidirectional approach brings.Pre-training and Fine-tuning BERT Model The BERT model undergoes a two-step process:Pre-training on Large amounts of unlabeled text to learn contextual embeddings.Fine-tuning on labeled data for specific NLP tasks.Pre-Training on Large DataBERT is pre-trained on large amount of unlabeled text data. The model learns contextual embeddings, which are the representations of words that take into account their surrounding context in a sentence.BERT engages in various unsupervised pre-training tasks. For instance, it might learn to predict missing words in a sentence (Masked Language Model or MLM task), understand the relationship between two sentences, or predict the next sentence in a pair.Fine-Tuning on Labeled DataAfter the pre-training phase, the BERT model, armed with its contextual embeddings, is then fine-tuned for specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This step tailors the model to more targeted applications by adapting its general language understanding to the nuances of the particular task.BERT is fine-tuned using labeled data specific to the downstream tasks of interest. These tasks could include sentiment analysis, question-answering, named entity recognition, or any other NLP application. The model's parameters are adjusted to optimize its performance for the particular requirements of the task at hand.BERT's unified architecture allows it to adapt to various downstream tasks with minimal modifications, making it a versatile and highly effective tool in natural language understanding and processing.How BERT work?BERT is designed to generate a language model so, only the encoder mechanism is used. Sequence of tokens are fed to the Transformer encoder. These tokens are first embedded into vectors and then processed in the neural network. The output is a sequence of vectors, each corresponding to an input token, providing contextualized representations.When training language models, defining a prediction goal is a challenge. Many models predict the next word in a sequence, which is a directional approach and may limit context learning. BERT addresses this challenge with two innovative training strategies:Masked Language Model (MLM)Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)1. Masked Language Model (MLM)In BERT's pre-training process, a portion of words in each input sequence is masked and the model is trained to predict the original values of these masked words based on the context provided by the surrounding words.In simple terms,Masking words: Before BERT learns from sentences, it hides some words (about 15%) and replaces them with a special symbol, like [MASK].Guessing Hidden Words: BERT's job is to figure out what these hidden words are by looking at the words around them. It's like a game of guessing where some words are missing, and BERT tries to fill in the blanks.How BERT learns:BERT adds a special layer on top of its learning system to make these guesses. It then checks how close its guesses are to the actual hidden words.It does this by converting its guesses into probabilities, saying, \"I think this word is X, and I'm this much sure about it.\"Special Attention to Hidden WordsBERT's main focus during training is on getting these hidden words right. It cares less about predicting the words that are not hidden.This is because the real challenge is figuring out the missing parts, and this strategy helps BERT become really good at understanding the meaning and context of words.In technical terms,BERT adds a classification layer on top of the output from the encoder. This layer is crucial for predicting the masked words.The output vectors from the classification layer are multiplied by the embedding matrix, transforming them into the vocabulary dimension. This step helps align the predicted representations with the vocabulary space.The probability of each word in the vocabulary is calculated using the SoftMax activation function. This step generates a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for each masked position.The loss function used during training considers only the prediction of the masked values. The model is penalized for the deviation between its predictions and the actual values of the masked words.The model converges slower than directional models. This is because, during training, BERT is only concerned with predicting the masked values, ignoring the prediction of the non-masked words. The increased context awareness achieved through this strategy compensates for the slower convergence.2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax.In the training process, BERT learns to understand the relationship between pairs of sentences, predicting if the second sentence follows the first in the original document.50% of the input pairs have the second sentence as the subsequent sentence in the original document, and the other 50% have a randomly chosen sentence.To help the model distinguish between connected and disconnected sentence pairs. The input is processed before entering the model:A [CLS] token is inserted at the beginning of the first sentence, and a [SEP] token is added at the end of each sentence.A sentence embedding indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token.A positional embedding indicates the position of each token in the sequence.BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax.During the training of BERT model, the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction are trained together. The model aims to minimize the combined loss function of the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction, leading to a robust language model with enhanced capabilities in understanding context within sentences and relationships between sentences.Why to train Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction together?Masked LM helps BERT to understand the context within a sentence and Next Sentence Prediction helps BERT grasp the connection or relationship between pairs of sentences. Hence, training both the strategies together ensures that BERT learns a broad and comprehensive understanding of language, capturing both details within sentences and the flow between sentences.BERT ArchitectureThe architecture of BERT is a multilayer bidirectional transformer encoder which is quite similar to the transformer model. A transformer architecture is an encoder-decoder network that uses self-attention on the encoder side and attention on the decoder side.BERTBASE has 12 layers in the Encoder stack while BERTLARGE has 24 layers in the Encoder stack. These are more than the Transformer architecture described in the original paper (6 encoder layers).BERT architectures (BASE and LARGE) also have larger feedforward networks (768 and 1024 hidden units respectively), and more attention heads (12 and 16 respectively) than the Transformer architecture suggested in the original paper. It contains 512 hidden units and 8 attention heads.BERTBASE contains 110M parameters while BERTLARGE has 340M parameters.BERT BASE and BERT LARGE architecture.This model takes the CLS token as input first, then it is followed by a sequence of words as input. Here CLS is a classification token. It then passes the input to the above layers. Each layer applies self-attention and passes the result through a feedforward network after then it hands off to the next encoder. The model outputs a vector of hidden size (768 for BERT BASE). If we want to output a classifier from this model we can take the output corresponding to the CLS token.BERT output as EmbeddingsNow, this trained vector can be used to perform a number of tasks such as classification, translation, etc. For Example, the paper achieves great results just by using a single layer Neural Network on the BERT model in the classification task. How to use BERT model in NLP?BERT can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as:1. Classification TaskBERT can be used for classification task like sentiment analysis, the goal is to classify the text into different categories (positive/ negative/ neutral), BERT can be employed by adding a classification layer on the top of the Transformer output for the [CLS] token.The [CLS] token represents the aggregated information from the entire input sequence. This pooled representation can then be used as input for a classification layer to make predictions for the specific task.2. Question AnsweringIn question answering tasks, where the model is required to locate and mark the answer within a given text sequence, BERT can be trained for this purpose.BERT is trained for question answering by learning two additional vectors that mark the beginning and end of the answer. During training, the model is provided with questions and corresponding passages, and it learns to predict the start and end positions of the answer within the passage.3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)BERT can be utilized for NER, where the goal is to identify and classify entities (e.g., Person, Organization, Date) in a text sequence.A BERT-based NER model is trained by taking the output vector of each token form the Transformer and feeding it into a classification layer. The layer predicts the named entity label for each token, indicating the type of entity it represents.How to Tokenize and Encode Text using BERT?To tokenize and encode text using BERT, we will be using the 'transformer' library in Python.Command to install transformers:!pip install transformersWe will load the pretrained BERT tokenize with a cased vocabulary using BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\").tokenizer.encode(text) tokenizes the input text and converts it into a sequence of token IDs.print(\"Token IDs:\", encoding) prints the token IDs obtained after encoding.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoding) converts the token IDs back to their corresponding tokens.print(\"Tokens:\", tokens) prints the tokens obtained after converting the token IDs\nPython\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer\n# Load pre-trained BERT tokenizer\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\n# Input text\ntext = 'ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture.

In the token IDs section, token id: 101 refers to the start of the sentence and token id: 102 represents the end of the sentence. Application of BERTBERT is used for:Text Representation: BERT is used to generate word embeddings or representation for words in a sentence.Named Entity Recognition (NER): BERT can be fine-tuned for named entity recognition tasks, where the goal is to identify entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, etc., in a given text.Text Classification: BERT is widely used for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization. It has demonstrated excellent performance in understanding and classifying the context of textual data.Question-Answering Systems: BERT has been applied to question-answering systems, where the model is trained to understand the context of a question and provide relevant answers. This is particularly useful for tasks like reading comprehension.Machine Translation: BERT's contextual embeddings can be leveraged for improving machine translation systems. The model captures the nuances of language that are crucial for accurate translation.Text Summarization: BERT can be used for abstractive text summarization, where the model generates concise and meaningful summaries of longer texts by understanding the context and semantics.Conversational AI: BERT is employed in building conversational AI systems, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and dialogue systems. Its ability to grasp context makes it effective for understanding and generating natural language responses.Semantic Similarity: BERT embeddings can be used to measure semantic similarity between sentences or documents. This is valuable in tasks like duplicate detection, paraphrase identification, and information retrieval.BERT vs GPTThe difference between BERTand GPT are as follows: BERTGPTArchitectureBERT is designed for bidirectional representation learning. It uses a masked language model objective, where it predicts missing words in a sentence based on both left and right context.GPT, on the other hand, is designed for generative language modeling. It predicts the next word in a sentence given the preceding context, utilizing a unidirectional autoregressive approach.Pre-training ObjectivesBERT is pre-trained using a masked language model objective and next sentence prediction. It focuses on capturing bidirectional context and understanding relationships between words in a sentence.GPT is pre-trained to predict the next word in a sentence, which encourages the model to learn a coherent representation of language and generate contextually relevant sequences.Context UnderstandingBERT is effective for tasks that require a deep understanding of context and relationships within a sentence, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question-answering.GPT is strong in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. It is often used in creative tasks, dialogue systems, and tasks requiring the generation of natural language sequences.Task types and Use Cases Commonly used in tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and question-answering.Applied to tasks such as text generation, dialogue systems, summarization, and creative writing.Fine-tuning vs Few-Shot LearningBERT is often fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks with labeled data to adapt its pre-trained representations to the task at hand.GPT is designed to perform few-shot learning, where it can generalize to new tasks with minimal task-specific training data.Also Check:Sentiment Classification Using BERTHow to Generate Word Embedding using BERT?BART Model for Text Auto Completion in NLPToxic Comment Classification using BERTNext Sentence Prediction using BERT\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nGenerative AI Applications\nP\npawangfg\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nNLP\nNatural-language-processing\nSimilar Reads\nArtificial Intelligence Tutorial | AI Tutorial  Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines which helps in allowing them to think and act like humans.
