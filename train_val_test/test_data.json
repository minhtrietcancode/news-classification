Tashdique Mehtaj Ahmed/Getty ImagesHeart attacks have become more survivable in the past 50 years, and are no longer the leading cause of heart disease-related deaths, a new study reports.As heart attack deaths fall, fatalities from other heart conditions are rising due to various factors, including higher rates of other forms of cardiovascular disease.In recent decades, deaths from heart disease have still been responsible for more U.S. fatalities than any other cause.Heart attacks are no longer the number one cause of heart-related deaths in the United States, according to a new report.Fatalities from heart attacks — acute myocardial infarctions — decreased by 89% from 1970 to 2022, the report, published on June 25 in the Journal of the American Heart Association, shows.Heart attacks are severe ischemic heart disease events in which blood flow to and from the heart is restricted. Ischemic heart disease was responsible for 91% of all heart disease-related deaths in 1970, declining to 53% by 2022.Heart disease overall has decreased by 66% since 1970, yet it remains the leading cause of death among Americans.With more people avoiding death from myocardial infarctions (MI), fatalities from other heart disease subtypes now represent 81% of heart-related deaths. These include:heart failure, for which fatalities have increased by 81%hypertension-related heart disease deaths, which have risen by 106%arrhythmia-related fatalities, which have increased by 450%Heart attack deaths drop in recent decadesJayne Morgan, MD, cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs for Hello Heart, told Healthline that the report does not indicate that fewer heart attacks are occurring. Morgan wasn’t involved in the new report.“I did not note a decline in myocardial infarctions themselves, but rather a decline in heart attacks being the primary cause of death,” she said. “As Americans, we are not that great at prevention. Our strength has been in the science and application of medicine.”“The inference is that more and more heart attacks are survivable now as compared to 55 years ago,” Morgan said.This is because emergency physicians have become better at saving people experiencing heart attacks with the help of contemporary medications, lifesaving procedures, and devices.Deaths from non-fatal heart attacksMorgan explained that the non-fatal heart attack “was the catalyst for the chain of events leading to eventual long-term chronic heart disease conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias.”“Patients who otherwise would have passed from their heart attack are now surviving, and then living longer dealing with the consequences,” Cheng-Han Chen, MD, board certified interventional cardiologist, told Healthline. Chen wasn’t involved in the new report.Chen described heart-muscle damage that non-fatal heart attacks often leave in their wake. The extent of that damage depends on the severity and duration of the attack. Weakness in the heart muscle can result in heart failure.It’s important to understand that heart failure does not mean that a heart has completely failed. Rather, it means that it is no longer functioning as well as it once did.“Heart failure is a spectrum in which the heart just doesn’t work perfectly,” said Chen. “It could be very mild, or it could be very severe and everything in-between.”“You can actually live with mild heart failure for the remainder of your life,” said Chen, “and it doesn’t really affect you that much, and you can control it with medication.”Another obvious result of non-fatal heart attacks is that people who survive them tend to live longer. Heart failure, hypertension-related heart disease, and arrhythmia are all associated with aging. Living longer only increases the odds of eventually developing these conditions.Lifestyle factors impact heart healthThe typical American lifestyle puts many people at a high risk for heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmia, Morgan noted.It is characterized, she said, by “obesity, hypertension, sedentary lifestyles, processed and palatable fast food, decreased physical movement, smoking, cholesterol, diabetes, as well as societal stressors leading to chronic inflammation.”She noted that socioeconomic issues complicate lifestyle risk factors and make addressing them especially difficult for many.“This includes pregnancy complications such as hypertension of pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, etc.,” Morgan added. “These all increase a woman’s lifetime risk of heart disease, and are still the primary drivers of maternal mortality outcomes.”The general decline in heart fatalities, however, indicates that some progress is being made against some of these risk factors.Sharp increase in arrhythmia-related deathsThe report found the most dramatic increase in arrhythmia-related deaths. Arrhythmias are disorders in which the rate at which the heart beats is abnormal. There are four main types of arrhythmia:bradycardia — slow heart ratetachycardia — fast heart rate ventricular arrhythmia — begins in the ventriclessupraventricular arrhythmia — begins above the ventricles (i.e., atrial fibrillation or irregular heartbeat)Arrhythmias are common and are often harmless. However, should an arrhythmia interfere with the heart’s ability to maintain blood flow, damage may occur to the heart, brain, lungs, and other vital organs. As the report describes, arrhythmias can be fatal.It is important to get annual checkups that include a heart-health examination.In addition, if you can feel your heart is beating without having your hand on your chest, it is a good idea to consult your doctor to be checked for arrhythmia.This is especially essential for heart-attack survivors. “Reducing the risk of arrhythmias after a myocardial infarction is crucial, as these irregular heart rhythms — especially ventricular arrhythmias — can be life threatening,” Morgan said.She cited several interventions that can help the survivor of a non-fatal heart attack avoid death from arrhythmia, including a four-drug combo known as the “foundational four” for managing HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction). Morgan said statins, cardiac rehab, implantable defibrillators, sleep apnea management, and lifestyle changes may also be valuable in such cases.AHA’s tips for staying heart-healthyThe American Heart Association (AHA) provides an eight-step framework for maintaining heart health:eat healthybe more activequit tobaccoget healthy sleepmanage your weightcontrol your cholesterolregulate your blood sugarmanage your blood pressureFor more information, visit the AHA’s Essential Eight website.

In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.Additional Types:Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered a subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.Module 1: Machine Learning PipelineIn order to make predictions there are some steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions. ML workflowData CleaningFeature ScalingData Preprocessing in PythonModule 2: Supervised Learning Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types: Classification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories Regression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values. Supervised Learning There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are:1. Linear RegressionThis is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output.Introduction to Linear RegressionGradient Descent in Linear RegressionMultiple Linear RegressionRidge RegressionLasso regressionElastic net Regression2. Logistic RegressionUsed when the output is a \"yes or no\" type answer. It helps in predicting categories like pass/fail or spam/not spam.Understanding Logistic RegressionCost function in Logistic Regression3. Decision TreesA model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a flowchart. Easy to understand and use.Decision Tree in Machine LearningTypes of Decision tree algorithmsDecision Tree - Regression (Implementation)Decision tree - Classification (Implementation)4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)A bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate different categories of data.Understanding SVMsSVM Hyperparameter Tuning - GridSearchCVNon-Linear SVM5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)This model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions. Super simple and based on similarity.Introduction to KNNDecision Boundaries in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)6. Naïve BayesA quick and smart way to classify things based on probability. It works well for text and spam detection.Introduction to Naive BayesGaussian Naive BayesMultinomial Naive BayesBernoulli Naive BayesComplement Naive Bayes7. Random Forest (Bagging Algorithm)A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability.Introduction to Random forestRandom Forest ClassifierRandom Forest RegressionHyperparameter Tuning in Random ForestIntroduction to Ensemble LearningEnsemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning:Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently.Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one.Module 3: Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose: Clustering Association Rule MiningDimensionality Reduction. Unsupervised learning1. ClusteringClustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. Types of clustering algorithms are:Centroid-based Methods:K-Means clusteringElbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeansK-Means++ clusteringK-Mode clusteringFuzzy C-Means (FCM) ClusteringDistribution-based Methods: Gaussian mixture modelsExpectation-Maximization AlgorithmDirichlet process mixture models (DPMMs)Connectivity based methods: Hierarchical clustering Agglomerative ClusteringDivisive clusteringAffinity propagationDensity Based methods: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)2. Dimensionality ReductionDimensionality reduction is used to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information.Principal Component Analysis (PCA)t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)Independent Component Analysis (ICA)IsomapLocally Linear Embedding (LLE)3. Association Rule Find patterns between items in large datasets typically in market basket analysis.Apriori algorithmImplementing apriori algorithmFP-Growth (Frequent Pattern-Growth)ECLAT (Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal)Module 4: Reinforcement LearningReinforcement learning interacts with environment and learn from them based on rewards.Reinforcement Learning1. Model-Based MethodsThese methods use a model of the environment to predict outcomes and help the agent plan actions by simulating potential results.Markov decision processes (MDPs)Bellman equationValue iteration algorithmMonte Carlo Tree Search2. Model-Free MethodsThe agent learns directly from experience by interacting with the environment and adjusting its actions based on feedback.Q-LearningSARSAMonte Carlo MethodsReinforce AlgorithmActor-Critic AlgorithmAsynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)Module 5: Semi Supervised LearningIt uses a mix of labeled and unlabeled data making it helpful when labeling data is costly or it is very limited.Semi Supervised LearningSemi Supervised ClassificationSelf-Training in Semi-Supervised LearningFew-shot learning in Machine LearningModule 6: Deployment of ML ModelsThe trained ML model must be integrated into an application or service to make its predictions accessible.

Josh — Earnings season is super annoying for trend-following investment strategies. The potential for both positive and negative surprises is higher, which can lead to reversals in trend and gappy trading before and after the opening and closing bells of trading. It can be a minefield. Sean and I try to avoid highlighting names right before they report for this reason. This time, however, we're going to break that tradition and show you a few set-ups for companies due to report this week. There are seven companies on our Best Stocks in the Market list reporting this week. One of them - Fastenal (FAST) - will have already released results prior to this column coming out. Three others have charts that appear to be losing momentum and threatening a downside breach of their uptrends - Kinder Morgan (KMI) , Abbott Labs (ABT) and Cintas (CTAS) — so we'll skip over those. The other three are worth taking a look at. BlackRock (BLK) , Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Netflix (NFLX) are all strong stocks at interesting inflection points. Let's do some high-level stats on the overall list and then we'll dive in. Sector Leaderboard As of 7/14/2025, there are 136 names on The Best Stocks in the Market list Top Sector Ranking: Top Industries: Top 5 Best Stocks by Relative Strength: Sector Spotlight: Sean — Coming into earnings, all 3 major indices are within 2% of all-time highs: While prices are at or near all-time highs, earnings estimates are not. Throughout Q2, EPS estimates for the S & P 500 have declined 4.2% for this upcoming earnings season. In most quarters, analysts are usually adjusting their estimates down, so this is nothing unusual. However, over the past 20 quarters, the average decline in EPS estimates during the quarter has been a decline of 3%. The average of the past 60 quarters (15 years) has been a decline of 3.2%. So, estimates have shifted further down than normal. On a sectoral basis, every sector saw EPS adjustments lowered, except for communications, which stayed flat. Energy, discretionary, and materials were the three worst sectors with the highest decline in estimates at -18.9%, -7.4%, and -6.4% respectively (from start of quarter to end of quarter). (Data via Factset) Either analysts are lowering the bar for what could be a better-than-expected earnings season, or analysts were too bullish on U.S. earnings power amidst a myriad of risks. This goes without saying, but earnings can be a tumultuous period for single stockholders. It's fair to assume most of a stock's earnings outcome is priced in, but more often than not, the market will have some type of response to earnings. In recent quarters, companies have beaten earnings but issued softer forward guidance; a lot of times, that bit of news is not priced in. Earnings can greatly affect the behavior of investors, and thus earnings can affect the technicals of a stock, which matter to us, a lot. We want to show a couple set-ups of stocks that report earnings this week, so that investors are prepared for a range of possible outcomes coming into these events. BlackRock (BLK) - reports on Tuesday: Sean — Wall Street expects revenue of $5.47 billion, up 13.8% year-over-year and EPS of $10.80, up 4.3% year-over-year. (data via S & P Global and Quartr) Josh — BlackRock exploded higher this summer as the flows into ETFs followed (propelled, some might say) the stock market up and to the right. BlackRock is one of the most pro-cyclical stocks in the market. When asset values are booming and investors want in, their asset gathering activity picks up and, with it, the investment management fees. BlackRock's \"all in\" initiatives around crypto and private equity products are a big part of the story. In the short term, this is an extended name, far above its 200-day. The recent record high and golden cross (50-day moving above the 200-day) make me want to give it the benefit of the doubt. If you're not already in the stock, I'd wait for the report to come out and focus on a buying opportunity into any profit-taking. So long as it holds above $1,000, I think you can be long. Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) - reports Thursday Sean — Wall Street expects revenue of $1.38 billion, up 11.8% year-over-year and EPS of $0.46, up 5.2% year-over-year. (data via S & P Global and Quartr) Josh — IBKR is emerging out of a cup-and-handle pattern which you can clearly see in the chart above. RSI at 71 could be considered \"overbought\" but I don't look at it that way. I see it as a sign of strength when it's accompanying new record high levels in price. Considering the outrageous rally in competitor Robinhood (HOOD) — up 112% since April 30th — this momentum in IBKR makes sense. HOOD is a good comp because, according to Morningstar, approximately 55% of IBKR's commission revenue is retail trading vs 45% institutional. One of the most important metrics IBKR is judged on each quarter is account growth — how many new brokerage clients are they adding to the platform. In Q4, Interactive added 217,000 new accounts, pushing the full year total to above 775,000. Then in Q1 they put up an even more explosive number, 279,000 new accounts, up 32% over the same quarter a year before. There's a seasonality to account opening activity, so expect the pace to decelerate when they report this week. But if the results are solid, there's no reason why this name can't break away and forge a new trading range above current resistance at $60. Netflix (NFLX) - reports on Thursday Sean — Wall Street expects revenue of $11.0 billion, up 15.5% year-over-year and EPS of $7.08, up 45.2% year-over-year. (data via S & P Global and Quartr) Josh — We've been writing positively about Netflix all spring and summer given the powerful rally and accompanying upside fundamental surprises along the way. Netflix continues to shock The Street. That said, recent price action says the stock may have gotten ahead of itself in the short-term. NFLX is in a 7% drawdown from its high, hopefully finding support at the 50-day moving average. I own the stock from lower levels and plan to remain long. If I had no position, I would wait and see rather than buy in anticipation of the earnings print. A \"sell the news\" reaction post-earnings might open up a better entry point. We'll follow up on this.

Each of these models may not be very strong on its own, but when we put their results together, we get a better and more accurate answer. It's like asking a group of people for advice instead of just one person—each one might be a little wrong, but together, they usually give a better answer.Types of Ensembles Learning in Machine LearningThere are three main types of ensemble methods:Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):Models are trained independently on different random subsets of the training data. Their results are then combined—usually by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification). This helps reduce variance and prevents overfitting.Boosting:Models are trained one after another. Each new model focuses on fixing the errors made by the previous ones. The final prediction is a weighted combination of all models, which helps reduce bias and improve accuracy.Stacking (Stacked Generalization):Multiple different models (often of different types) are trained, and their predictions are used as inputs to a final model, called a meta-model. The meta-model learns how to best combine the predictions of the base models, aiming for better performance than any individual model.1. Bagging AlgorithmBagging classifier can be used for both regression and classification tasks. Here is an overview of Bagging classifier algorithm:Bootstrap Sampling: Divides the original training data into ‘N’ subsets and randomly selects a subset with replacement in some rows from other subsets. This step ensures that the base models are trained on diverse subsets of the data and there is no class imbalance.Base Model Training: For each bootstrapped sample we train a base model independently on that subset of data. These weak models are trained in parallel to increase computational efficiency and reduce time consumption. We can use different base learners i.e. different ML models as base learners to bring variety and robustness.Prediction Aggregation: To make a prediction on testing data combine the predictions of all base models. For classification tasks it can include majority voting or weighted majority while for regression it involves averaging the predictions.Out-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation: Some samples are excluded from the training subset of particular base models during the bootstrapping method. These “out-of-bag” samples can be used to estimate the model’s performance without the need for cross-validation.Final Prediction: After aggregating the predictions from all the base models, Bagging produces a final prediction for each instance.Python pseudo code for Bagging Estimator implementing libraries:1. Importing Libraries and Loading DataBaggingClassifier: for creating an ensemble of classifiers trained on different subsets of data.DecisionTreeClassifier: the base classifier used in the bagging ensemble.load_iris: to load the Iris dataset for classification.train_test_split: to split the dataset into training and testing subsets.accuracy_score: to evaluate the model’s prediction accuracy.\nPython\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n2. Loading and Splitting the Iris Datasetdata = load_iris(): loads the Iris dataset, which includes features and target labels.X = data.data: extracts the feature matrix (input variables).y = data.target: extracts the target vector (class labels).train_test_split(...): splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with random_state=42 to ensure reproducibility.\nPython\ndata = load_iris()\nX = data.data\ny = data.target\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n3. Creating a Base ClassifierDecision tree is chosen as the base model. They are prone to overfitting when trained on small datasets making them good candidates for bagging.base_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(): initializes a Decision Tree classifier, which will serve as the base estimator in the Bagging ensemble.\nPython\nbase_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()\n4. Creating and Training the Bagging ClassifierA BaggingClassifier is created using the decision tree as the base classifier.n_estimators = 10 specifies that 10 decision trees will be trained on different bootstrapped subsets of the training data.\nPython\nbagging_classifier = BaggingClassifier(base_classifier, n_estimators=10, random_state=42)\nbagging_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n5. Making Predictions and Evaluating AccuracyThe trained bagging model predicts labels for test data.The accuracy of the predictions is calculated by comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) to the actual labels (y_test).\nPython\ny_pred = bagging_classifier.predict(X_test)\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\nOutput:Accuracy: 1.02. Boosting AlgorithmBoosting is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. Weak models are trained in series such that each next model tries to correct errors of the previous model until the entire training dataset is predicted correctly. One of the most well-known boosting algorithms is AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting). Here is an overview of Boosting algorithm:Initialize Model Weights: Begin with a single weak learner and assign equal weights to all training examples.Train Weak Learner: Train weak learners on these dataset.Sequential Learning: Boosting works by training models sequentially where each model focuses on correcting the errors of its predecessor. Boosting typically uses a single type of weak learner like decision trees.Weight Adjustment: Boosting assigns weights to training datapoints. Misclassified examples receive higher weights in the next iteration so that next models pay more attention to them.Python pseudo code for boosting Estimator implementing libraries:1. Importing Libraries and ModulesAdaBoostClassifier from sklearn.ensemble: for building the AdaBoost ensemble model.DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree: as the base weak learner for AdaBoost.load_iris from sklearn.datasets: to load the Iris dataset.train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection: to split the dataset into training and testing sets.accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics: to evaluate the model’s accuracy.\nPython\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n2. Loading and Splitting the Datasetdata = load_iris(): loads the Iris dataset, which includes features and target labels.X = data.data: extracts the feature matrix (input variables).y = data.target: extracts the target vector (class labels).train_test_split(...): splits the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with random_state=42 to ensure reproducibility.\nPython\ndata = load_iris()\nX = data.data\ny = data.target\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n3. Defining the Weak LearnerWe are creating the base classifier as a decision tree with maximum depth 1 (a decision stump). This simple tree will act as a weak learner for the AdaBoost algorithm, which iteratively improves by combining many such weak learners.\nPython\nbase_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)\n4. Creating and Training the AdaBoost Classifierbase_classifier: The weak learner used in boosting.n_estimators = 50: Number of weak learners to train sequentially.learning_rate = 1.0: Controls the contribution of each weak learner to the final model.random_state = 42: Ensures reproducibility.\nPython\nadaboost_classifier = AdaBoostClassifier(\nbase_classifier, n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1.0, random_state=42\n)\nadaboost_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n5. Making Predictions and Calculating AccuracyWe are calculating the accuracy of the model by comparing the true labels y_test with the predicted labels y_pred. The accuracy_score function returns the proportion of correctly predicted samples. Then, we print the accuracy value.\nPython\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\nOutput:Accuracy: 1.0Benefits of Ensemble Learning in Machine LearningEnsemble learning is a versatile approach that can be applied to machine learning model for: -Reduction in Overfitting: By aggregating predictions of multiple model's ensembles can reduce overfitting that individual complex models might exhibit.Improved Generalization: It generalizes better to unseen data by minimizing variance and bias.Increased Accuracy: Combining multiple models gives higher predictive accuracy.Robustness to Noise: It mitigates the effect of noisy or incorrect data points by averaging out predictions from diverse models.Flexibility: It can work with diverse models including decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines making them highly adaptable.Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Techniques like bagging reduce variance, while boosting reduces bias leading to better overall performance.There are various ensemble learning techniques we can use as each one of them has their own pros and cons.Ensemble Learning TechniquesTechniqueCategoryDescriptionRandom ForestBaggingRandom forest constructs multiple decision trees on bootstrapped subsets of the data and aggregates their predictions for final output, reducing overfitting and variance.Random Subspace MethodBaggingTrains models on random subsets of input features to enhance diversity and improve generalization while reducing overfitting.Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)BoostingGradient Boosting Machines sequentially builds decision trees, with each tree correcting errors of the previous ones, enhancing predictive accuracy iteratively.Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)BoostingXGBoost do optimizations like tree pruning, regularization, and parallel processing for robust and efficient predictive models.AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)BoostingAdaBoost focuses on challenging examples by assigning weights to data points.

But sparse autoencoders go one step ahead by introducing a regularization term to avoid overfitting and forcing the learning of compact, interpretable features. This ensures that the network is not merely copying the input data but rather learns a compressed, meaningful representation of the data.Objective Function of a Sparse AutoencoderL = ||X - \\hat{X}||^2 + \\lambda \\cdot \\text{Penalty}(s)X: Input data.\\hat{X}: Reconstructed output.\\lambda: Regularization parameter.Penalty(s): A function that penalizes deviations from sparsity, often implemented using KL-divergence.Techniques for Enforcing SparsityThere are several methods to enforce the sparsity constraint:L1 Regularization: Introduces a penalty proportional to the absolute weight values, encouraging the model to utilize fewer features.KL Divergence: Estimates how much the average activation of hidden neurons deviates from the target sparsity level, such that a subset of neurons is activated at any time.Training Sparse AutoencodersTraining a sparse autoencoder typically involves:Initialization: Weights are initialized randomly or using pre-trained networks.Forward Pass: The input is fed through the encoder to obtain the latent representation, followed by the decoder to reconstruct the output.Loss Calculation: The loss function is computed, incorporating both the reconstruction error and the sparsity penalty.Backpropagation: The gradients are calculated and used to update the weights.Preventing the Autoencoder from OverfittingSparse autoencoders address an important issue in normal autoencoders: overfitting. In a normal autoencoder with an increased hidden layer, the network can simply \"cheat\" and replicate the input data to the output without deriving useful features. Sparse autoencoders address this by restricting how many of the hidden layer neurons are active at any given time, thus nudging the network to learn only the most critical features.Implementation of a Sparse Autoencoder for MNIST DatasetThis is an implementation that shows how to construct a sparse autoencoder with TensorFlow and Keras  in order to learn useful representations of the MNIST dataset. The model induces sparsity in the hidden layer activations, making it helpful for applications such as feature extraction.Step 1: Import LibrariesWe start by importing the libraries required for handling the data, constructing the model, and visualization.\nPython\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nStep 2: Load and Preprocess the MNIST DatasetWe then load the MNIST dataset,  which is a set of handwritten digits. We preprocess the data as well by reshaping and normalizing the pixel values.Reshaping: We convert the 28x28 images into a flat vector of size 784.Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1].\nPython\n(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()\nx_train = x_train.reshape((x_train.shape[0], -1)).astype('float32') / 255.0\nx_test = x_test.reshape((x_test.shape[0], -1)).astype('float32') / 255.0\nStep 3: Define Model ParametersWe define the model parameters, including the input dimension, hidden layer size, sparsity level, and the sparsity regularization weight.\nPython\ninput_dim = 784\nhidden_dim = 64\nsparsity_level = 0.05\nlambda_sparse = 0.1\nStep 4: Build the Autoencoder ModelWe construct the autoencoder model using Keras. The encoder reduces the dimension of the input data to lower dimensions, whereas the decoder attempts to recreate the original input based on this lower-dimensional representation.\nPython\ninputs = layers.Input(shape=(input_dim,))\nencoded = layers.Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')(inputs)\ndecoded = layers.Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)\nautoencoder = keras.Model(inputs, decoded)\nencoder = keras.Model(inputs, encoded)\nStep 5: Define the Sparse Loss FunctionWe create a custom loss function that includes both the mean squared error (MSE) and a sparsity penalty using KL divergence. This encourages the model to learn a sparse representation.\nPython\ndef sparse_loss(y_true, y_pred):\nmse_loss = tf.reduce_mean(keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y_true, y_pred))\nhidden_layer_output = encoder(y_true)\nmean_activation = tf.reduce_mean(hidden_layer_output, axis=0)\nkl_divergence = tf.reduce_sum(sparsity_level * tf.math.log(sparsity_level / (mean_activation + 1e-10)) +\n(1 - sparsity_level) * tf.math.log((1 - sparsity_level) / (1 - mean_activation + 1e-10)))\nreturn mse_loss + lambda_sparse * kl_divergence\nStep 6: Compile the ModelWe compile the model with the Adam optimizer and the custom sparse loss function.\nPython\nautoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=sparse_loss)\nStep 7: Train the AutoencoderThe model is trained on the training data for a specified number of epochs. We shuffle the data to ensure better training.\nPython\nhistory = autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=50, batch_size=256, shuffle=True)\nOutput: Epoch 1/50235/235 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 4s 8ms/step - loss: 0.2632. . .Epoch 50/50235/235 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 2s 5ms/step - loss: 0.0281Step 8: Reconstruct the InputsAfter training, we use the autoencoder to reconstruct the test data and visualize the results.\nPython\nreconstructed = autoencoder.predict(x_test)\nStep 9: Visualize Original vs. Reconstructed ImagesWe visualize the original images alongside their reconstructed counterparts to assess the model's performance.\nPython\nn = 10\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 4))\nfor i in range(n):\n# Original images\nax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1)\nplt.imshow(x_test[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')\nplt.title(\"Original\")\nplt.axis('off')\n# Reconstructed images\nax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1 + n)\nplt.imshow(reconstructed[i].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')\nplt.title(\"Reconstructed\")\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\nOutput: Reconstructed ImagesStep 10: Analyze Encoded RepresentationsWe obtain the encoded representations and visualize them to understand the features learned by the autoencoder.\nPython\nencoded_outputs = encoder.predict(x_train)\n# Visualize encoded features\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\nplt.scatter(encoded_outputs[:, 0], encoded_outputs[:, 1])  # Assuming hidden_dim is 2 for visualization\nplt.title(\"Encoded Representations\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Encoded Dimension 1\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Encoded Dimension 2\")\nplt.show()\nOutputEncoded RepresentationsStep 11: Analyze Mean Activation of Hidden UnitsFinally, we analyze the mean activation of the hidden units to understand how sparsity is achieved in the model.\nPython\nmean_activation = np.mean(encoded_outputs, axis=0)\nplt.bar(range(len(mean_activation)), mean_activation)\nplt.title(\"Mean Activation of Hidden Units\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Hidden Units\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Mean Activation\")\nplt.show()\nOutputMean ActivationApplications of Sparse AutoencodersSparse autoencoders have a wide range of applications in various fields:Feature Learning: They can be employed to learn a sparse representation of high-dimensional data, which can subsequently be employed for classification or regression purposes.Image Denoising: Sparse autoencoders can be employed to denoise images by learning to capture salient features and disregard unnecessary noise.Anomaly Detection: By training on normal data, sparse autoencoders can identify outliers based on reconstruction error.Data Compression: They can effectively compress data by reducing its dimensionality while retaining important features.Advantages of Sparse AutoencodersEfficiency: They can learn efficient representations with fewer active neurons, leading to reduced computational costs.Interpretability: The sparsity constraint usually tends to create more interpretable features, which in turn can assist in interpreting the underlying structure of the data.Robustness: Sparse autoencoders have the potential to be more resistant to noise and overfitting because of the regularization effect they provide.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nAutoencoders in Machine Learning\nA\narupchowdhury50\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nSimilar Reads\nMasked Autoencoders in Deep Learning Masked autoencoders are neural network models designed to reconstruct input data from partially masked or corrupted versions, helping the model learn robust feature representations.

Investors have been largely pushing past the threat of ongoing tariffs placed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite each hit a fresh high on Thursday, illustrating how far the market has come since its significant losses in early April. Still, the S & P 500 ended the week at a loss, a sign of how sentiment remains uneasy amid unpredictable trade policy. As the second half gets underway, the firm's co-head of Americas equities research Pedro Martins Junior surveyed JPMorgan's top-ranked U.S. equity research analysts to find their \"most compelling structural and tactical short ideas\" for the rest of 2025. These short ideas identify companies that JPMorgan analysts believe will see a decline in share price, giving investors an opportunity to profit from those downturns. The firm gave stock ideas across a variety of sectors, including consumer, health care, technology and energy. Take a look at eight of the short picks below: Tesla, rated underweight by JPMorgan analysts, is one of the firm's top short ideas. Analyst Ryan Brinkman said the electric vehicle company has a \"sky-high valuation\" compared with the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech names, despite his forecast for Tesla's earnings per share to decline for a third consecutive year in 2025. \"Reduced EV subsidies threaten already marginal profitability (EBIT margin below GM & Ford). Robo-taxi effort likely to disappoint, given lack of sensor redundancy,\" Brinkman said about Tesla. Tesla shares are down nearly 22% year to date. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an X post earlier this week that the company is expanding its robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, and is bringing xAI's controversial AI chatbot Grok to Tesla vehicles. Washing machines and refrigerator manufacturer Whirlpool is another stock JPMorgan views as a strong short pick, primarily due to its high valuation. \"We expect WHR to underperform its peers this earnings season, as we point to the stock's strong performance since June 1, up 38%, versus our universe's average 14% gain (ex- WHR; S & P up 6%), as well as its expensive valuation compared to history, trading at EV/EBITDA multiples more than 15% above its 5 and 10-year averages,\" analyst Michael Rehaut wrote to clients. Shares are down more than 5% year to date. Rehaut is keeping a neutral rating on Whirlpool given the company's potential to benefit from U.S. tariff policies. Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer said last month that U.S. duties could add between $50 and $70 to the retail price of appliances made by competing companies, giving Whirlpool a potential edge. The company has touted itself as \"a net winner of new tariff policies\" since 80% of its products are made domestically. WHR 1Y mountain Whirlpool stock performance. Other stocks JPMorgan says to short are Moderna , Mobileye Global and Shake Shack . The firm is notably bearish on Moderna, which is down 19% for the year even after seeing shares make a more than 20% recovery over the past month. \"We do not see a near-term catalyst that is likely to drive MRNA stock significantly higher,\" analyst Jessica Fye said. \"The combination of ongoing cash burn, coupled with regulatory headwinds and legal issues, make MRNA a tough story to be constructive on near-term.\" Wall Street analysts covering Moderna have a consensus price target that forecasts about 40% upside. But out of the 26 analysts, 18 have a hold rating on shares while three have an underperform rating.More In Analyst CallsThis Chinese robotaxi stock can more than double as production ramps up, analysts say Brian EvansHere are Monday's biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Rivian, Best Buy, Taiwan Semiconductor, Coinbase and moreMichael BloomEvercore ISI downgrades Procter & Gamble as it loses market share on AmazonLisa Kailai HanRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

The muni market, in general, has been the worst-performing fixed-income asset class so far this year through the second quarter, said Dan Close, head of municipals at Nuveen. That has created a unique opportunity to nab the bonds at bargain prices — with yields that are approaching 10-year highs, he said. Yields move inversely to prices, so the market's recent weakness equates to higher yields. For instance, an AA-rated water revenue bond from New York City Water Finance Authority that has a 4.75% tax free yield equals a taxable equivalent yield of about 10.6% for residents in the highest tax bracket, Close said. Water revenue bonds are primarily AA-rated obligations, he noted. They generally finance projects related to water infrastructure like water treatment plants and pipelines. \"You're approaching equity-like returns for what some would argue is the safest sector in municipals,\" Close said in an interview with CNBC. \"This sector, historically, has had one of the lowest default instances in the municipal space.\" As essential service monopoly bonds, they are minimally affected by tariffs and economic slowdowns, he added. \"If these essential service monopolies that are super low defaults are going in and producing these outsized yields, now might be an opportunity to take a look at water and sewer and, by extension, the entire municipal asset class,\" he said. FLAAX YTD mountain Nuveen All-American Municipal Bond Fund in 2025. Nuveen's All American Municipal Bond Fund holds water revenue munis, including those issued by the Great Lakes Water Authority. A-shares of the fund have a 30-day SEC yield of 4.07% and a 0.76% gross expense ratio. The Nuveen Intermediate Duration Municipal Bond Fund also holds water revenue bonds from issuers such as Honolulu City and County. The fund's A-shares have a 3.11% 30-day SEC yield and a 0.65% gross expense ratio. $1.2 trillion investment needed The country's deteriorating infrastructure and the remediation of \" forever chemicals\" such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl , or PFAS, from drinking water are going to drive bond issuance in the sector, Close said. \"Aging systems can pose serious public safety risks, from frequent water main breaks to lead contamination and waterborne disease,\" he wrote in a recent note . Some $1.2 trillion in investments over the next 20 years are needed to address these infrastructure concerns, according to reports from the Environmental Protection Agency . On top of that, remediation of PFAS from drinking water needs to be funded, Close told CNBC. PFAS comes from products like nonstick cookware or certain food packaging and don't easily break down in the environment or, if ingested, in bodies. \"It's going to impact 15% of utilities in the United States,\" he said. \"This alone to remediate this new risk is going to cost between $40 and $90 billion.\" The EPA finalized rules last year requiring utilities to reduce exposure to PFAS in drinking water. But last month the agency said it will weaken limits on some of the chemicals. Shorter term, a less-aggressive EPA may make the metrics look better for utilities as future capital plans get pushed out, Close noted. \"[However], you have to continue to invest in your infrastructure in order to be able to meet the growing needs of delivering water and sewer [services] to the average household,\" he said. Meanwhile, water scarcity is a challenge in the West and Southwest, Close said. That means investments in projects to recycle, desalinate and conserve water, he noted. For instance, the Southern California Metropolitan Water District has been facing supply constraints thanks to ongoing droughts, he pointed out. It plans to build a multi-billion dollar water recycling plant , along with its partner the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts.
