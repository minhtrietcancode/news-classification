As a systemic, or whole-body therapy, it can also affect your overall health in ways beyond cancer treatment.Immune suppression is a common concern when it comes to chemotherapy side effects. Chemotherapy can change how well your bone marrow produces white blood cells — the cells that help you ward off infections.If you’re in an immune-compromised phase of treatment, monitoring what you eat can help reduce your risk of dangerous foodborne infections.What should you not eat during chemotherapy?Foods to avoid while on chemotherapy are those that may increase your risk of foodborne illnesses.Catalina Ruz Gatica, a registered dietitian who specializes in chronic illness at Top Nutrition Coaching in Chicago, explained, “For those undergoing chemotherapy, it’s particularly important to avoid foods such as undercooked or raw meats, raw fish, food past its expiration date, or unwashed produce.”Knowing which foods may be high risk can be tricky. Some products that may seem safe — such as Caesar salad dressing — can contain items like uncooked eggs.Dry-cured or smoked meatsProducts like dry-cured raw salami or smoked fish are preserved through drying, salting, and exposure to heat and smoke. While these processes can inhibit bacteria growth, they may not be as effective as high temperatures in killing all potentially harmful pathogens.According to the National Center for Home Food Preservation, for example, certain molds are resistant to salt and can grow inside cured meats after they’re sliced.Unpasteurized milk productsPasteurization is the heat-based sterilization process used for many commercially packaged, sealed foods, including:dairy productsjuicessandwich meatsegg productsnut buttersYou may want to avoid raw milk products, such as unpasteurized yogurt, during chemotherapy because they haven’t undergone sterilization. These products include soft or blue-veined cheeses made with unpasteurized milk, such as:blue cheesebriestiltonRoquefortGorgonzolaqueso blanco frescoOpen-case products and bulk-bin itemsSalads and meats stored in deli coolers for the day may be kept cold, but they’re potentially exposed to pathogens every time the door opens for an employee.The same goes for bulk-bin items, such as cereal, that you can dish out yourself. You may not know what these foods were exposed to when the last person opened the bin.Unwashed fruits, sprouts, and vegetablesFruits and vegetables can be an important part of getting nutrients during chemotherapy, but they should always be washed or cooked before consumption to avoid surface contaminants that may make you ill.This precaution includes packaged products made from fresh produce, such as salsas and unpasteurized “fresh squeezed” juices. Sprouts also need to be cooked because they have a higher risk of bacterial growth.Undercooked meatsCooking meat to the appropriate temperature is one of the safest food habits to perform during chemotherapy. High temperatures kill pathogens on the outside of the meat as well as internally.You may want to avoid any undercooked meat, including those deliberately left raw, such as sushi, sashimi, and lox.Raw egg Raw eggs, including cooked eggs with runny yolks, are notorious for possibly carrying Salmonella bacteria, but products containing raw eggs can be challenging to spot.Items that may contain raw egg include:smoothieshomemade eggnoghomemade mayonnaiseuncooked cookie doughhollandaise sauceCaesar salad dressingRaw nuts or fresh nut buttersRaw nuts may seem safe because of their low moisture content and long shelf life, but certain pathogens such as Salmonella don’t need much moisture to thrive.Avoiding raw nuts and their products, such as fresh nut butters, can help lower your risk of a foodborne illness in the same way as it does for raw vegetables.The Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention notes that long storage times for nut products may also increase the risk of illness related to fungi growth.Cream-filled baked goodsBaked goods that contain cream fillings often have a milk base, which can be an ideal medium in which foodborne pathogens may grow.Raw honey or honeycombThe use of raw honey during cancer treatment is controversial.Some evidence suggests honey may have a variety of anticancer properties, but at the same time, it can potentially carry dangerous pathogens such as those that may cause botulism.Certain waterUsing water directly from wells, springs, or streams may expose you to microorganisms and pathogens that cause illness, such as:Escherichia coli (E. coli)CryptosporidiumLegionellaFoods to boost your immune system during chemotherapyWith the rules of washing, cooking, and sourcing in mind, there are plenty of helpful foods to eat during chemotherapy.According to Ruz Gatica, some foods may even boost your immunity.“There are certain foods that can support the body’s immune function during chemotherapy. Foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E, selenium, and zinc are particularly beneficial for the immune system,” she said.Vitamin-rich sources can be found in foods such as:sweet potatoesbroccolisquashpumpkin seedslentilssalmoneggsRemember, it’s not that you can’t eat eggs or vegetables while undergoing chemotherapy. As long as they’re properly prepared, they can be a part of maintaining overall health.Ruz Gatica suggested, “If symptoms like poor appetite occur while undergoing chemotherapy, consuming these immune-supportive foods as small, frequent meals can help meet energy needs without exacerbating symptoms.”Why is diet important in chemotherapy?Diet management during chemotherapy is important as a means of warding off infection, but it’s also how you can keep your body as healthy as possible to aid in cancer treatment and minimize the side effects of chemotherapy.“When it comes to going through chemotherapy, what’s on your plate really matters,” indicated Ruz Gatica. “Eating the right foods helps keep your body’s engine running smoothly, supporting metabolic and functional health while warding off any chance of malnutrition.”She added that by ensuring you get enough protein, calories, vitamins, and minerals, you’re helping your body stay strong and resilient throughout treatment.TakeawayFoods to avoid while on chemotherapy are those that may increase your chances of food-related illness.While anyone can become sick from eating a contaminated product, chemotherapy knocks your immune system down and can make you more vulnerable to infections.Focusing on thoroughly cooked foods and washed produce, as well as skipping bin-style and deli cooler items, are simple rules that can help you eat the right foods during cancer treatment. How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Cox/Getty ImagesESPNJul 14, 2025, 11:20 PM ETEmailPrintOpen Extended ReactionsCal Raleigh is your 2025 MLB All-Star Home Run Derby champion!The Seattle Mariners slugger not only takes home his first Derby title in his first appearance after outlasting Tampa Bay Rays star Junior Caminero, but he becomes the first catcher to win the event.It was a power-packed night in Atlanta as Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Oneil Cruz hit a ball a whopping 513 feet for the longest blast of the night before being eliminated in the semifinal. Hometown star Matt Olson of the Atlanta Braves was eliminated in the first round despite starting his outing off hot, while New York Yankees second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. hit just three shots in his first-round exit. Athletics DH Brent Rooker and Washington Nationals left fielder were the other two knocked out early, paving the way for Raleigh, Caminero, Cruz and Minnesota Twins center fielder Byron Buxton to take center stage at Truist Park.We have your one-stop shop for everything Derby related, from the round-by-round results to our favorite moments from one of the most anticipated events of the summer.Takeaways from the Home Run DerbyJorge Castillo: The Home Run Derby's tiebreaker rule for the first round needs an overhaul. Rooker said he thought he was headed for a swing-off against Raleigh to determine who advanced to the semifinals once he saw Raleigh had tied him with 17 home runs and a longest distance of 471 feet. He even got loose to prepare for one.Then Raleigh told Rooker he was eliminated because Raleigh had hit his longest home run at 470.61 feet as compared to Rooker's 470.53, per Statcast. That difference, Rooker noted, was not displayed for the contestants to see and adjust accordingly. A disparity that slim should fall within a margin for error (are we sure Statcast is that accurate?) and warrant a swing-off, which is the tiebreaker used for the semifinals and the final. The Derby almost always steers clear of any controversy; this year was a bit different.Editor's Picks'It's something that's never been done': Why the 'Big Dumper's' Derby win was only the beginning4hJeff PassanOlney: Breaking down the Derby contestants -- and their pitchers17hBuster OlneyShocks at No. 1 -- and No. 2?! Winners, losers and takeaways from MLB draft Day 11dAlden Gonzalez, +2 More2 RelatedJesse Rogers: Raleigh, the \"Big Dumper,\" was great, as expected. But this might have been a welcome-to-the-big-stage moment for Caminero. He looked effortless at the plate in his first Derby appearance, blasting home runs over the short wall in left field. The night began with Cruz hitting a 513-foot home run and ended with a battle between Caminero and the eventual winner. While Raleigh and Cruz might garner more headlines for their exploits -- as will Chisholm for hitting just three homers in his first-round exit -- it is Caminero who might have been the most impressive considering his age, as at 22 he would have made history as the youngest Derby winner. Caminero will win this event soon enough.David Schoenfield: It's been a miracle first half for Raleigh with 38 home runs, and he showed why he's on pace for 64 homers on the season with an impressive display of raw power and exquisite timing on Monday night. With his dad pitching and his younger brother catching, it also will go down as one of the more memorable winning performances. Next up: battling Aaron Judge for MVP honors and leading the Mariners to their first American League West title since 2001 -- and maybe the first World Series appearance in franchise history. Dream big, Mariners fans, just like 8-year-old Cal Raleigh.MLB Home Run Derby resultsFinal\nCal Raleigh (18) vs. Junior Caminero (15)Semifinal\n3. Byron Buxton (7) vs. 2. Junior Caminero (8)\n4.

Matt Olson: 15 home runs (eliminated)Updates and analysis from the Derby\nOur pre-Derby predictionsWho is going to win the Derby and who will be the runner-up?Jeff Passan: Raleigh. His swing is perfect for the Derby: He leads MLB this season in both pull percentage and fly ball percentage, so it's not as if he needs to recalibrate it to succeed. He has also become a prolific hitter from the right side this season -- 16 home runs in 102 at-bats -- and his ability to switch between right- and left-handed pitching offers a potential advantage. No switch-hitter (or catcher for that matter) has won a Home Run Derby. The Big Dumper is primed to be the first, beating Buxton in the finals.Alden Gonzalez: Cruz. He might be wildly inconsistent at this point in his career, but he is perfect for the Derby -- young enough to possess the stamina required for a taxing event that could become exhausting in the Atlanta heat; left-handed, in a ballpark where the ball carries out better to right field; and, most importantly, capable of hitting balls at incomprehensible velocities. Raleigh will put on a good show from both sides of the plate but will come in second.Buster Olney: Olson. He is effectively pinch-hitting for Acuna, and because he received word in the past 72 hours of his participation, he hasn't had the practice rounds that the other competitors have been going through. But he's the only person in this group who has done the Derby before, which means he has experienced the accelerated pace, adrenaline and push of the crowd.His pitcher, Eddie Perez, knows something about performing in a full stadium in Atlanta. And, as Olson acknowledged in a conversation Sunday, the park generally favors left-handed hitters because of the larger distances that right-handed hitters must cover in left field.The most obscure MLB All-Stars everFrom World War II fill-ins and a shortstop with a 37 OPS+ to this year's Rockies rep.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nJesse Rogers: Olson. Home-field advantage will mean something this year as hitting in 90-plus degree heat and humidity will be an extra challenge in Atlanta. Olson understands that and can pace himself accordingly. Plus, he was a late addition. He has got nothing to lose. He'll outlast the young bucks in the field. And I'm not putting Raleigh any lower than second -- his first half screams that he'll be in the finals against Olson.Jorge Castillo: Wood. His mammoth power isn't disputed -- he can jack baseballs to all fields. But the slight defect in his power package is that he doesn't hit the ball in the air nearly as often as a typical slugger. Wood ranks 126th out of 155 qualified hitters across the majors in fly ball percentage. And he still has swatted 24 home runs this season. So, in an event where he's going to do everything he can to lift baseballs, hitting fly balls won't be an issue, and Wood is going to show off that gigantic power en route to a victory over Cruz in the finals.Who will hit the longest home run of the night -- and how far?Passan: Cruz hits the ball harder than anyone in baseball history. He's the choice here, at 493 feet.Gonzalez: If you exclude the Coors Field version, there have been just six Statcast-era Derby home runs that have traveled 497-plus feet. They were compiled by two men: Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton. James Wood -- all 6-foot-7, 234 pounds of him -- will become the third.Olney: James Wood has the easy Stanton- and Judge-type power, and he will clear the Chophouse with the longest homer. Let's say 497 feet.Rogers: Hopefully he doesn't injure himself doing it, but Buxton will break out his massive strength and crush a ball at least 505 feet. I don't see him advancing far in the event, but for one swing, he'll own the night.Castillo: Cruz hits baseballs hard and far. He'll crush a few bombs, and one will reach an even 500 feet.Who is the one slugger fans will know much better after the Derby?One trade every MLB team should makeFrom a Cy Young winner to an All-Star closer, here's one player every MLB team should trade for (or away) this July.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nPassan: Buxton capped his first half with a cycle on Saturday, and he'll carry that into the Derby, where he will remind the world why he was baseball's No. 1 prospect in 2015. Buxton's talent has never been in question, just his health. And with his body feeling right, he has the opportunity to put on a show fans won't soon forget.Olney: Caminero isn't a big name and wasn't a high-end prospect like Wood was earlier in his career. Just 3½ years ago, Caminero was dealt to the Rays by the Cleveland Guardians in a relatively minor November trade for pitcher Tobias Myers. But since then, he has refined his ability to cover inside pitches and is blossoming this year into a player with ridiculous power. He won't win the Derby, but he'll open some eyes.What's the one moment we'll all be talking about long after this Derby ends?Gonzalez: The incredible distances and velocities that will be reached, particularly by Wood, Cruz, Caminero, Raleigh and Buxton. The hot, humid weather at Truist Park will only aid the mind-blowing power that will be on display Monday night.Rogers: The exhaustion on the hitter's faces, swinging for home run after home run in the heat and humidity of Hot-lanta!Castillo: Cruz's 500-foot blast and a bunch of other lasers he hits in the first two rounds before running out of gas in the finals.\nTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads© ESPN Enterprises, Inc.

Well, it can even be said of the new electricity in today's world. But to be precise what is Machine Learning, well it's just one way of teaching the machine by feeding a large amount of data. To know more about Machine learning and its algorithms you can refer to some links that are provided in the Reference sections of this article.\nToday, we will create an Image Classifier of our own that can distinguish whether a given pic is of a dog or cat or something else depending upon your fed data. To achieve our goal, we will use one of the famous machine learning algorithms out there which are used for Image Classification i.e. Convolutional Neural Network(or CNN).\nSo basically what is CNN - as we know it's a machine learning algorithm for machines to understand the features of the image with foresight and remember the features to guess whether the name of the new image is fed to the machine. Since it's not an article explaining CNN so I'll add some links in the end if you guys are interested in how CNN works and behaves. So after going through all those links let us see how to create our very own cat-vs-dog image classifier. For the dataset we will use the Kaggle dataset of cat-vs-dog:\nNow after getting the data set, we need to preprocess the data a bit and provide labels to each of the images given there during training the data set. To do so we can see that name of each image of the training data set is either start with \"cat\" or \"dog\" so we will use that to our advantage then we use one hot encoder for the machine to understand the labels(cat[1, 0] or dog[0, 1]).\ndef label_img(img):\nword_label = img.split('.')[-3]\n# DIY One hot encoder\nif word_label == 'cat': return [1, 0]\nelif word_label == 'dog': return [0, 1]Libraries Required:\nTFLearn - Deep learning library featuring a higher-level API for TensorFlow used to create layers of our CNNtqdm - Instantly make your loops show a smart progress meter, just for simple design sakenumpy - To process the image matricesopen-cv - To process the image like converting them to grayscale and etc.os - To access the file system to read the image from the train and test directory from our machinesrandom - To shuffle the data to overcome the biasingmatplotlib - To display the result of our predictive outcome.TensorFlow - Just to use the tensorboard to compare the loss and adam curve our result data or obtained log.TRAIN_DIR and TEST_DIR should be set according to the user's convenience and play with the basic hyperparameters like an epoch, learning rate, etc to improve the accuracy. I have converted the image to grayscale so that we will only have to deal with a 2-d matrix otherwise 3-d matrix is tough to directly apply CNN to, especially not recommended for beginners. Below here is the code which is heavily commented on otherwise you can find the code here in my GitHub account from this link.\nPython3\n# Python program to create\n# Image Classifier using CNN\n#

This tutorial is designed for both beginners and experienced professionals and covers key concepts such as Image Processing, Feature Extraction, Object Detection, Image Segmentation and other core techniques in CV.Before moving into computer vision, it is recommended to have a foundational understanding of: Machine LearningDeep LearningOpenCVThese areas form the foundation of computer vision which helps us apply techniques and algorithms more effectively If we're unfamiliar with any of these topics, we recommend checking out their respective tutorials to build a solid foundation.Mathematical Prerequisites for Computer VisionBefore moving into Computer Vision, having a foundational understanding of certain mathematical concepts will help us which includes:1.

Feature Descriptors Feature Descriptors SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) How Does Computer Vision Work?Computer Vision works much like the human eye and brain. First, our eyes capture the image and send the visual data to our brain. The brain then processes this information and transforms it into a meaningful interpretation, recognizing and categorizing the object based on its properties.In a similar way, Computer Vision uses a camera (acting like the human eye) to capture images. The visual data is then processed by algorithms to recognize and identify the objects based on patterns it has learned. However, before the system can recognize objects in new images, it needs to be trained on a large dataset of labeled images. This training enables the system to identify and associate various patterns with their corresponding labels.For example, imagine providing a computer with thousands of bird song recordings. The system learns by analyzing features like pitch, rhythm and duration. Once trained, it can then recognize whether a new sound resembles a bird song or not.For more details you can refer to: Steps in Computer VisionPopular Libraries for Computer VisionTo implement computer vision tasks effectively, various libraries are used:OpenCV: Mostly used open-source library for computer vision tasks like image processing, video capture and real-time applications.TensorFlow: A popular deep learning framework that includes tools for building and training computer vision models.PyTorch: Another deep learning library that provides great flexibility for computer vision tasks for research and development.scikit-image: A part of the scikit-learn ecosystem, this library provides algorithms for image processing and computer vision.For more details you can refer to: Computer Vision LibrariesDeep Learning for Computer Vision Deep learning has greatly enhanced computer vision by allowing machines to understand and analyze visual data and its key deep learning models include:1.

This article offers concise yet comprehensive advantages of these algorithms from their foundational principles to practical applications. Let's uncover the strategies that drive intelligent gameplay in adversarial environments. Table of Content\nWhat is an Adversarial search?Adversarial search algorithmsMinimax algorithmAlpha-beta pruningAdversarial search algorithm Implementations using Connect-4 GameApplications of adversarial search algorithmsConclusionFAQ’s on Adversarial search algorithmsWhat is an Adversarial search?The Adversarial search is a well-suited approach in a competitive environment, where two or more agents have conflicting goals.  The adversarial search can be employed in two-player zero-sum games which means what is good for one player will be the misfortune for the other. In such a case, there is no win-win outcome. In artificial intelligence, adversarial search plays a vital role in decision-making, particularly in competitive environments associated with games and strategic interactions. By employing adversarial search, AI agents can make optimal decisions while anticipating the actions of an opponent with their opposing objectives. It aims to establish an effective decision for a player by considering the possible moves and the counter-moves of the opponents. The adversarial search in competitive environments can be utilized in the below scenarios where the AI system can assist in determining the best course of action by both considering the possible moves and counter-moves of the opponents. Each agent seeks to boost their utility or minimize their loss. One agent’s action impacts the outcomes and objectives of the other agents. Additionally, strategic uncertainty arises when the agents may lack sufficient information about each other’s strategies. Role of Adversarial Search in AIGame-playing: The Adversarial search finds a significant application in game-playing scenarios, including renowned games like chess, Go, and poker. The adversarial search offers the simplified nature of these games that represents the state of a game in a straightforward approach and the agents are limited to a small number of actions whose effects are governed by precise rules. Decision-making: Decision-making plays a central role in adversarial search algorithms, where the goal is to find the best possible move or strategy for a player in a competitive environment against one or more components. This requires strategic thinking, evaluation of potential outcomes, and adaptive decision-making throughout the game.  Adversarial search algorithmsThe search algorithms like DFS, BFS, and A* can be well-suited for single-agent environments where there is no direct competition or conflict between multiple agents. These algorithms are suitable for finding an optimal solution in such scenarios. On the other hand, in zero-sum games where two players compete directly against each other, adversarial search algorithms like Minmax and Alpha-Beta pruning are more appropriate since these algorithms can determine the best course of action for each player in zero-sum games. Minimax algorithmThe Minimax algorithm is claimed to be a recursive or backtracking algorithm that is responsible for choosing the best optimal move in the conflicting environment. The Minimax algorithm operates on a tree structure known as the game tree, which is the collection of all the possible moves in the corresponding game  states in a given game.  The game tree’s leaf node accommodates all the possible moves. The game state denotes the current board condition. With every single move, the game state changes and the game tree gets updated height-wise. When visualized, this game tree often resembles an inverted tree, with the root representing the current game state and the branches representing possible moves.This algorithm simply works by proceeding down to the tree until it reaches the leaf node and then it backs up the minimax values through the tree as the recursion unwinds. The prime motive of the Minimax algorithm is to maximize the chance of winning for the maximizer. In the game tree, every node is assigned weights that influence the chances of winning, the higher the weights, the higher the chances of winning. Key terminologies in the Minimax algorithmMinimax Tree: A tree structure shows all possible moves and game states in a game, used by Minimax to find the best move.MAX (Maximizer) - Maximizer seeks favorable outcomes in games by maximizing chances of winning for themselves as players.MIN (Minimizer) - Minimizer reduces winning chances, making moves leading to least favorable outcome for the Maximizer in games.Initial state - Starting state of game board, representing the configuration at the beginning of the game.Terminal state -Terminal states are the final outcomes of a game board, resulting in either a win, loss, or draw.Heuristic Evaluation Function: Function evaluates game states for maximizer, assigning numerical values to each game state based on piece positions, material advantage, and board control.How Minimax search algorithm help in finding the optimal strategy?Terminal state: The Minimax value of each state in the game tree can be used to determine the optimal strategy. The MINIMAX(s) refers to the utility of being in that state that assumes both players play optimally from there to the end of the game. Non-terminal state: In the case of the non-terminal state, when MAX's turn arrives at the game, MAX aims to move which leads to a state of maximum value, conversely MIN prefers to choose the move that leads to a state of minimum value. It can be formulated as below:\\begin{aligned}\nMINIMAX(S) = \\begin{cases}\n&UTILITY(s, \\text{MAX}) \\rightarrow \\text{if } IS\\_TERMINAL(s), \\\\\n&\\max_{a \\in Actions(s)} \\text{ } MINIMAX(RESULT(s,a)) \\rightarrow \\text{if } TO\\_MOVE(s) = \\text{MAX}, \\\\\n&\\min_{a \\in Actions(s)} \\text{ } MINIMAX(RESULT(s,a)) \\rightarrow \\text{if } TO\\_MOVE(s) = \\text{MIN}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\nPseudocode for Minimax algorithmThe Pseudocode for the Minimax algorithm is given below:MINIMAX(node, depth, maximizingPlayer): This function recursively evaluates the minimax value of each node in the game tree. It alternated between maximizing and minimizing player nodes based on the maximizingPlayer parameterMINIMAX(node, depth, maximizingPlayer):    if depth is 0 or node is a terminal node:        return the heuristic value of node    if maximizingPlayer:        bestValue = -INFINITY        for each child of node:            value = MINIMAX(child, depth - 1, FALSE)            bestValue = max(bestValue, value)        return bestValue    else:        bestValue = +INFINITY        for each child of node:            value = MINIMAX(child, depth - 1, TRUE)            bestValue = min(bestValue, value)        return bestValuefindBestMove(board): This function is responsible for iterating through all possible moves on the board and evaluates each moves using minimax algorithm. Then it returns the moves with the highest minimax value for the maximizing player. findBestMove(board):    bestValue = -INFINITY    bestMove = NULL    for each possible move in board:        if move is valid:            make the move on the board            value = MINIMAX(board, depth, FALSE)            undo the move on the board            if value > bestValue:                bestValue = value                bestMove = move    return bestMoveUnderstanding the Minimax algorithm: Decision-making in game treesThe minimax algorithm is a backtracking algorithm that recursively tries different possibilities and backtracks when the solution is not found. In the context of the Minimax algorithm, this involves exploring all possible moves in the game tree that evaluate each potential outcome and making decisions based on the evaluations. The diagram below represents the binary tree that holds the possible game states and moves in a game, with each leaf node representing a final game state. figure(a) Example of Minimax algorithm that holds the possible game statesMaximizer and MinimizerIn the Minimax algorithm, there are two players such as the maximizer and the minimizer. The maximizer aims to maximize its score (e.g., by winning the game), conversely, the minimizer aims to minimize the maximizer’s score (e.g., by preventing the maximizer from winning).Example of decision-makingInitial decision-making: An example scenario in Figure (a) within the perfect binary tree causes the maximizer to make the first move at the root. The maximizer has the option to choose to traverse through the tree, in this case, it needs to choose the path between left or right. Minimizer’s choice: Assuming that maximizer traverses to the left where it reaches the minimizer node, the minimizer has the responsibility of selecting the optimal value and it chooses between two values (2 and 5). The objective of the minimizer is to minimize the maximizer's score, so it chooses the lowest value 2. The value 2 is then passed to the root node so that it can be compared later when the player earns an optimal value when he traverses to the right side of the game tree. Figure (b) Minimizer's choiceTraversal to the Right: The maximizer then traverses to the right side of the game tree and encounters another set of decision nodes. Eventually, it reaches another minimizer node where the minimizer again selects the optimal minimal value 1 among its options.Figure (c) The maximizer traversing through the rightRecursive process: The process continues recursively where each player makes decisions based on whether they are maximizer or minimizer and the objective of maximizing or minimizing the score respectively. Comparison and outcome: The maximizer node (root node) already holds the value of 2, when the player earns another optimal value that is 1 while traversing in the right path, it is then compared to get the final optimal value.  The maximizer earns the optimal value 2 based on the decisions made by both players. Final outcome of binary game treeTime and Space complexity of Minimax algorithm Time complexityThe minimax algorithm explores the complete game tree using a depth-first search approach that considers all possible moves at each level. The time complexity of the minimax algorithm can be written as,                                          O(bm)b - denotes the legal moves available at each point,m - denotes the maximum depth of the tree.This complexity arises because, at each level of the tree, the minimax algorithm must consider all b legal moves and this process repeats recursively for m levels until a terminal state is reached. Space complexityThe space complexity of the minimax algorithm relies on how the algorithm generates and stores the actions. In the case, where if all the possible actions are generated and stored simultaneously, the space complexity can be written as                                             O(bm)b - denotes the legal moves available at each point,m - denotes the maximum depth of the tree.This arises because the algorithm needs to store all the possible actions at each level of the game tree which leads to exponential growth in space requirements with the depth of the tree. However, if the actions are generated and processed one at a time, the space complexity reduces to O(m).Alpha-beta pruningAlpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for a minimax algorithm. It reduces computation time by a huge factor, allowing the user to traverse faster and deeper into the tree. It stops evaluating when at least one possibility has been found that typically proves the move to be worse than the previously examined move. The minimax search is based on depth-first search which considers the nodes along a single path in a tree. But Alph-Beta pruning bonds with two major parameters in MAX-VALUE(state, alpha, beta), representing Alpha plays a maximizer role, whereas Beta plays a minimizer role. Alpha - denotes the value of the best or highest value.Beta - denotes the value of the best or lowest value. Why Alpha-beta pruning is considered as an effective algorithm in the adversarial search? Branch elimination: The Alpha-beta pruning algorithm relies on the branches of the game tree that can be eliminated which promotes the more promising subtree by limiting the search time. Branch and bound: Alpha-beta pruning is based on the branch and bound method which offers a way to solve the optimization problem by dividing them into sub-problems. It allows the algorithm to effectively remove the branches that did not yield the optimal solution.Heuristic improvements: To limit the computation time, the heuristic Alpha-beta tree search cuts off the search early and applies the heuristic evaluation function to states that treat the non-terminal nodes as if they were terminal nodes. Pseudocode for Alpha-beta pruningThe Pseudocode for Alpha-beta pruning is given belowfunction ALPHA-BETA(node, depth, alpha, beta, maximizingPlayer):    if depth == 0 or node is a terminal node:        return the heuristic value of node    if maximizingPlayer:        for each child of node:            alpha = max(alpha, ALPHA-BETA(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, FALSE))            if beta <= alpha:                break   // Beta cut-off        return alpha    else:        for each child of node:            beta = min(beta, ALPHA-BETA(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, TRUE))            if beta <= alpha:                break   // Alpha cut-off        return betaUnderstanding the Alpha-beta pruning: Decision-making in game treesGame trees can hold abounding branches that can lead to different game states and implementing alpha-beta pruning in such game trees can help to prune away the branches if there already exists a better move. This makes the algorithm computationally efficient since there is no need to search the other branches if there already exists a better move in the game tree. At any node in the game tree, the maximizing player is used to store the maximum score in the alpha which assures that the max node contains only the maximum scores. Similarly, the minimizing player is assured of a minimum value which is stored by the beta. These two values of alpha and beta are updated and maintained by the algorithm.Take a look at the below example, initially both players begin with the worst possible values they can score, therefore the alpha is assigned with the value of minus infinity, whereas the beta is assigned with the value of plus infinity. We have a condition to prune the branches, if the alpha is greater than or equal to the beta value then we can prune the branch. Note: alpha is the maximizer and beta is the minimizer.Initially, the maximizer node A sets alpha to negative infinity and beta to positive infinity. Assuming that node A selects node B which inherits these values. Node B which is also a maximizer picks node D. At D, the maximizer chooses the max value (4) and then updates its alpha. Upon returning to B (minimizer), it compares its current beta with D’s alpha value. If D’s alpha is smaller, B’s beta value gets updated. In our example, B’s beta gets updated since D’s alpha value is smaller. Initial game stateNow, node B selects node E and passes down its current alpha and beta values to node E. Node E inherits the alpha value of negative infinity and beta value of 4. As a maximizer, E explores its left leaf node that holds a value of 5. Since 5 is greater than negative infinity, E’s alpha gets updated. Given that alpha is greater than beta, the other leaf node in E is unnecessary to explore so it gets pruned.values of B and D were foundAt node B, it compares its beta value with node E’s alpha, if E’s alpha value is lesser than B’s beta updates with E’s alpha. However, if E’s alpha is greater than B’s beta, B’s beta remains unchanged. In our example, since B’s beta is not greater than E’s alpha, so B’s beta value remains the same. Returning to node A, its alpha value updates with B’s beta value because B’s beta is greater than A’s alpha.The maximizer yields the value 4At node A, the maximizer’s alpha becomes 4 ensuring a value of 4 or higher. A then explores its right child which is node R. At C, alpha is 4 and beta is positive infinity. C then chooses its left child F. Node F inherits the alpha value 4 and beta value positive infinity from the parent node. F’s left child yields 0 updating the F’s alpha to 4 and also F’s right child yields 1. Although F can achieve 1, alpha remains 4. C receives 1 from F which makes the beta 1. As alpha is greater than beta, the entire subtree of node G gets pruned. This pruning logic ensures that, as C is guaranteed 1 or less, it’s irrational for A to choose C over B, where A is already guaranteed 4. The Maximizer still holds the max value 4 and  branch G gets pruned.Adversarial search algorithm Implementations using Connect-4 GameConnect-4 is a game played between two players who take turns dropping discs of their chosen color into a vertically suspended grid with seven columns and six rows. The objective is to be the first to form a line of four of one’s discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally is considered a win. The game is considered solved when a player can always win or is forced to draw. This implies that there exists an optimal strategy for both players ensuring that the outcome of the game can be determined in advance. The Connect-4 game is said to be a zero-sum game because the advantage of one player will be the disadvantage of its opponent. In this example, we will be using the Minimax algorithm to find the optimal strategy in the connect-4 game. Take a look at the below illustration, The player X chose the color red and the player O chose the color blue. In the below environment, it's now player O's turn to make a move. We will implement a minimax algorithm to find the optimal strategy for player O.Connect-4 game where the player O should make the optimal move to win the gameImplementation of Connect-4 using Minimax algorithmStep 1: Check if there are any moves leftis_moves_left: This function checks if there are any empty cells left on the game board. If there are any empty cells left, it returns the value True which indicates that there are moves left to be made. Otherwise, it returns False indicating that the game board is full and no moves can be made.\nPython\ndef is_moves_left(board):\nfor row in board:\nfor cell in row:\nif cell == '':\nreturn True\nreturn False\nStep 2: Evaluate the boardevaluate: We define this function to evaluate the current state of the game board and it returns a score based on whether there is a winning configuration for a player O such as horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If there is a winning configuration it returns a score of 10, otherwise it returns 0.\nPython\ndef evaluate(b):\nfor row in range(6):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row][col+1] == b[row][col+2] == b[row][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col] == b[row+2][col] == b[row+3][col] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col+1] == b[row+2][col+2] == b[row+3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3, 6):\nfor col in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row - 1][col+1] == b[row-2][col+2] == b[row - 3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nreturn 0\nStep 3: Implement the Minimax algorithmminimax: We define the minimax function to implement the minimax algorithm that makes decision-making simpler in two-player games. It recursively evaluates the possible moves and returns the best score for the current player.\nPython\ndef minimax(board, depth, is_max):\nscore = evaluate(board)\nif score == 10:\nreturn score - depth\nif not is_moves_left(board):\nreturn 0\nif is_max:\nbest_value = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'x'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\nelse:\nbest_value = float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\nStep 4: Find the optimal move for player Ofind_optimal_move: We define this function to discover the optimal move for player O by simulating all possible moves and evaluating their scores using the minimax algorithm. It returns the coordinates of the best move.\nPython\ndef find_optimal_move(board):\nbest_move = None\nbest_val = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nmove_val = minimax(board, 0, False)\nboard[row][col] = ''\nif move_val > best_val:\nbest_val = move_val\nbest_move = (row, col)\nbreak\nreturn best_move\nStep 5: Test the given board configurationHere, we will test the given board configuration and print out the optimal move for player O to win a game. If there is no possible winning move, it prints a message indicating that player O cannot win with the current board configuration.\nPython\nboard = [\n['x', 'x', 'o', '', '', '', 'x'],\n['o', 'o', 'o', 'x', '', '', 'x'],\n['x', 'o', '', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'o', 'o', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'x', 'x', 'o', '', '', ''],\n['o', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', '', '']\n]\noptimal_move = find_optimal_move(board)\nif optimal_move:\nprint(\"The optimal move for player O to win is:\", optimal_move)\nelse:\nprint(\"Player O cannot win with the current board confguration\")\nComplete code\nPython\ndef is_moves_left(board):\nfor row in board:\nfor cell in row:\nif cell == '':\nreturn True\nreturn False\ndef evaluate(b):\nfor row in range(6):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row][col+1] == b[row][col+2] == b[row][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col] == b[row+2][col] == b[row+3][col] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3):\nfor col in range(4):\nif b[row][col] == b[row+1][col+1] == b[row+2][col+2] == b[row+3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nfor row in range(3, 6):\nfor col in range(3):\nif b[row][col] == b[row - 1][col+1] == b[row-2][col+2] == b[row - 3][col+3] == 'o':\nreturn 10\nreturn 0\ndef minimax(board, depth, is_max):\nscore = evaluate(board)\nif score == 10:\nreturn score - depth\nif not is_moves_left(board):\nreturn 0\nif is_max:\nbest_value = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'x'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\nelse:\nbest_value = float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nbest_val = max(best_val, minimax(\nboard, depth+1, not is_max))\nboard[row][col] = ''\nbreak\nreturn best_val\ndef find_optimal_move(board):\nbest_move = None\nbest_val = -float('inf')\nfor col in range(7):\nfor row in range(5, -1, -1):\nif board[row][col] == '':\nboard[row][col] = 'o'\nmove_val = minimax(board, 0, False)\nboard[row][col] = ''\nif move_val > best_val:\nbest_val = move_val\nbest_move = (row, col)\nbreak\nreturn best_move\nboard = [\n['x', 'x', 'o', '', '', '', 'x'],\n['o', 'o', 'o', 'x', '', '', 'x'],\n['x', 'o', '', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'o', 'o', '', '', '', ''],\n['x', 'x', 'x', 'o', '', '', ''],\n['o', 'o', 'x', 'o', 'x', '', '']\n]\noptimal_move = find_optimal_move(board)\nif optimal_move:\nprint(\"The optimal move for player O to win is:\", optimal_move)\nelse:\nprint(\"Player O cannot win with the current board confguration\")\nOutput:The optimal move for player O to win is: (2,2)Output ExplanationOutput of Connect-4 where the player O winsTake a look at the above output illustration, the player O won when he chose the optimal move such as (2,2). It's important to note that there are multiple possible moves that player O could have made to potentially win the game. However, in the given illustration only seven states of the game board are shown to demonstrate the process of finding the optimal move using the minimax algorithm.Applications of adversarial search algorithmsBoard games: Adversarial search is most widely used in various board games like Chess, Checkers, Go and Connect Four. The above-explained algorithms can help the computers to play against human opponents or other computer players.Game Theory: Adversarial search forms the basis of game theory, which is used in various fields like economics, political science, and biology to model strategic interactions between rational decision-makers.Puzzle-solving: Adversarial search algorithms can be used to solve puzzles and optimization problems where the goal is to find the best sequence of moves or actions to achieve a desired outcome. ConclusionAdversarial search algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool with diverse applications across numerous domains. From mastering complex board games to enhancing cybersecurity, robotics, and automated negotiation systems, these algorithms facilitate strategic decision-making in dynamic competitive environments.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) in Artificial Intelligence\nT\ntejashreeganesan\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nBlogathon\nArtificial Intelligence\nAI-ML-DS\nSimilar Reads\nArtificial Intelligence Tutorial | AI Tutorial  Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines which helps in allowing them to think and act like humans.
