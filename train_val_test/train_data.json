The article discusses the process involved in performing Swiss Roll reduction with LLE, including the steps of loading and preprocessing the data, fitting the LLE model, and visualizing the reduced data. The article also provides a Python implementation of the process, with a code walkthrough and output examples. The article concludes with observations on the effectiveness of LLE in reducing the dimensionality of the Swiss Roll dataset.What is Swiss Roll?The Swiss roll is a toy dataset in scikit learn that is commonly used for testing and demonstrating nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms. It consists of a set of points in three dimensions, arranged in a \"roll\" shape, such that the points on the roll are mapped to a two-dimensional plane in a nonlinear fashion. The points on the Swiss roll are often colored so that the resulting plot of the reduced data can be visualized more easily.The Swiss roll dataset is often used because it is easy to generate and visualize, and because it exhibits a nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA. It is also a useful benchmark for comparing the performance of different nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms.What is Swiss Roll reduction?Swiss roll reduction is the process of reducing the dimensionality of the Swiss roll dataset from three dimensions to two or fewer dimensions, using a dimensionality reduction algorithm. The goal of this process is to represent the original data in a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the underlying structure of the data as possible.There are many techniques that can be used for Swiss roll reduction, including linear techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and nonlinear techniques such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, and t-SNE. Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses and can be more or less effective depending on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.In general, linear techniques such as PCA are faster and more computationally efficient, but may not be able to capture complex nonlinear structures in the data. Nonlinear techniques, on the other hand, can capture more complex structures but may be slower and more computationally intensive. Choosing the right technique for Swiss roll reduction will depend on the specific goals of the analysis and the characteristics of the data.What is Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)?Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) is a method for nonlinear dimensionality reduction that is based on the idea of modeling the local structure of the data by reconstructing it from a linear combination of its neighbors. The idea behind LLE is to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the relationships between nearby points while ignoring the relationships between more distant points.To perform LLE, the algorithm first selects a set of neighbors for each point in the data, based on some measure of similarity such as Euclidean distance. It then fits a linear model to these neighbors, using the original high-dimensional coordinates as the input variables and the low-dimensional coordinates as the output variables. This allows the algorithm to reconstruct each point in the data as a linear combination of its neighbors, using the low-dimensional coordinates as the coefficients. The low-dimensional coordinates are then optimized to minimize the reconstruction error.LLE has a number of attractive properties, including its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its ability to preserve the local structure of the data. However, it can be sensitive to the choice of the number of neighbors and the dimensionality of the output space, and may not perform well on data with a complex global structure.The process involved in Swiss Roll reduction with LLE?Here is a general outline of the process involved in reducing the dimensionality of the Swiss roll dataset using Locally Linear Embedding (LLE):Load the Swiss roll dataset: The first step is to load the Swiss roll dataset and store it in a variable X. This can be done using scikit-learn's make_swiss_roll function.Fit the LLE model to the data: Next, you can use scikit-learn's LocallyLinearEmbedding class to fit an LLE model to the data. This requires specifying the number of dimensions in the reduced data (n_components) and the number of neighbors to use in the reconstruction process (n_neighbors). You can also specify other optional parameters, such as the distance metric to use for selecting neighbors.Transform the data: Once the LLE model has been fit to the data, you can use the transform method to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This will return a new set of coordinates for the data points, with the specified number of dimensions.Optionally, compute the reconstruction error of the model using the reconstruction_error_ attribute of the LocallyLinearEmbedding object.Visualize the reduced data: Finally, you can visualize the reduced data using a scatter plot or other suitable visualization technique. This can help you understand the structure of the data and assess the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction process. Plot the original Swiss Roll data in 3D and the transformed data in the lower-dimensional space using Matplotlib.Here is an example of a comprehensive Python code that demonstrates how to use Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) for Swiss roll reduction in scikit-learn, including pre-processing and comparison with PCA, and visualization steps\nPython\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_swiss_roll\nfrom sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n# Generate the data\nX, y = make_swiss_roll(n_samples=2000, noise=0.5)\n# Fit the model with LLE\nlle = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_components=2, n_neighbors=10)\nX_lle = lle.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_lle = lle.reconstruction_error_\n# Fit the model with PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_pca = 1 - sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)\nIn this code, we are using the make_swiss_roll function from scikit-learn to generate a synthetic 3D dataset, known as the Swiss Roll. The Swiss Roll is a toy dataset used for demonstrating nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. It consists of a rolled-up 2D plane, with points on the plane randomly distributed and colored.\nPython\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_swiss_roll\nfrom sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n# Generate the data\nX, y = make_swiss_roll(n_samples=2000,\nnoise=0.5)\nNext, we apply two different dimensionality reduction techniques to the Swiss Roll dataset: Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), PCA is applied for comparison purposes with LLE. LLE is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that seeks to preserve the local structure of the data by reconstructing each point as a linear combination of its neighbors. PCA, on the other hand, is a linear dimensionality reduction method that seeks to find the directions of maximum variance in the data and projects the data onto a new lower-dimensional space along these directions.To apply LLE, we use the LocallyLinearEmbedding class from scikit-learn. We initialize the class with the number of dimensions we want to reduce the data to (in this case, 2), and the number of neighbors to use for the reconstruction of each point. Then, we fit the model to the data using the fit_transform method, which returns the transformed data in the lower-dimensional space. We also compute the reconstruction error of the LLE model using the reconstruction_error_ attribute of the LocallyLinearEmbedding object.\nPython\n# Fit the model with LLE\nlle = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_components=2,\nn_neighbors=10)\nX_lle = lle.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_lle = lle.reconstruction_error_\nTo apply PCA, we use the PCA class from scikit-learn. We initialize the class with the number of dimensions we want to reduce the data to (in this case, 2) and fit the model to the data using the fit_transform method, which returns the transformed data in the lower-dimensional space. We also compute the reconstruction error of the PCA model by summing up the explained variance ratios of the selected components.\nPython\n# Fit the model with PCA\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)\nreconstruction_error_pca = 1 - sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)\nFinally, we plot the original Swiss Roll data in 3D, the transformed Swiss Roll data using LLE in 2D, and the transformed Swiss Roll data using PCA in 2D. The plots show the data points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane, so we can see how well the dimensionality reduction techniques have preserved the structure of the data. The plot titles also display the reconstruction error for each method.\nPython\n# Plot the original data\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nax.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], X[:, 2],\nc=y, cmap=plt.cm.cool)\nplt.title('Original Swiss Roll')\nplt.show()\nOutput: In the plot of the original Swiss Roll data, you should see a 3D scatterplot with points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane. The points should form a spiral shape, with the colors changing smoothly along the spiral. This represents the original structure of the data, with points on the plane randomly distributed and colored.\nPython\n# Plot the transformed data with LLE\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.scatter(X_lle[:, 0], X_lle[:, 1], c=y, cmap=plt.cm.cool)\nplt.title(\nf'Transformed Swiss Roll with LLE\\\n(reconstruction error = {reconstruction_error_lle:.2f})')\nplt.show()\nOutput: In the plot of the transformed Swiss Roll data using LLE, you should see a 2D scatterplot with points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane.\nPython\n# Plot the transformed data with PCA\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))\nplt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1],\nc=y, cmap=plt.cm.cool)\nplt.title(\nf'Transformed Swiss Roll with PCA \\\n(reconstruction error = {reconstruction_error_pca:.2f})')\nplt.show()\nOutput: In the plot of the transformed Swiss Roll data using PCA, you should see a 2D scatterplot with points colored by their original position on the rolled-up plane. The points should not necessarily form a spiral shape, as PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction method and may not be able to capture the nonlinear structure of the data. However, the points should still be somewhat ordered by color, indicating that PCA has been able to preserve some of the structure of the data by finding the directions of maximum variance.Overall, the output plots allow us to compare the performance of LLE and PCA in preserving the structure of the Swiss Roll data after dimensionality reduction. The reconstruction error for each method, displayed in the plot titles, provides a quantitative measure of this performance. A lower reconstruction error indicates better preservation of the original structure of the data.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nOrdinary Least Squares (OLS) using statsmodels\nV\nvinayedula\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nTechnical Scripter\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nTechnical Scripter 2022\npython\n+1 More\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learningpython\nSimilar Reads\nMachine Learning Algorithms  Machine learning algorithms are essentially sets of instructions that allow computers to learn from data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

This makes the model faster and more efficient.Translation Invariance: Pooling helps the network become invariant to small translations or distortions in the input image. For example, even if an object in an image is slightly shifted, the pooled output will remain relatively unchanged.Overfitting Prevention: By reducing the spatial dimensions, pooling layers help prevent overfitting by providing a form of regularization.Feature Hierarchy: Pooling layers help build a hierarchical representation of features, where lower layers capture fine details and higher layers capture more abstract and global features.Types of Pooling Layers1. Max PoolingMax pooling selects the maximum element from the region of the feature map covered by the filter. Thus, the output after max-pooling layer would be a feature map containing the most prominent features of the previous feature map. Max pooling layer preserves the most important features (edges, textures, etc.) and provides better performance in most cases.Max Pooling in Keras:\nPython\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import MaxPooling2D\nimport numpy as np\n# Example input feature map\nfeature_map = np.array([\n[1, 3, 2, 9],\n[5, 6, 1, 7],\n[4, 2, 8, 6],\n[3, 5, 7, 2]\n]).reshape(1, 4, 4, 1)\n# Applying max pooling\nmax_pool = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=2)\noutput = max_pool(feature_map)\nprint(output.numpy().reshape(2, 2))\nOutput: [[6 9] [5 8]]2. Average PoolingAverage pooling computes the average of the elements present in the region of feature map covered by the filter. Thus, while max pooling gives the most prominent feature in a particular patch of the feature map, average pooling gives the average of features present in a patch. Average pooling provides a more generalized representation of the input. It is useful in the cases where preserving the overall context is important. Average Pooling using Keras:\nPython\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import AveragePooling2D\nfeature_map = np.array([\n[1, 3, 2, 9],\n[5, 6, 1, 7],\n[4, 2, 8, 6],\n[3, 5, 7, 2]\n], dtype=np.float32).reshape(1, 4, 4, 1)  # Convert to float32\n# Applying average pooling\navg_pool = AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2), strides=2)\noutput = avg_pool(feature_map)\nprint(output.numpy().reshape(2, 2))\nOutput: [[3.75 4.75] [3.5  5.75]]3. Global PoolingGlobal pooling reduces each channel in the feature map to a single value, producing a 1 \\times 1 \\times n_c output. This is equivalent to applying a filter of size n_h × n_w. There are two types of global pooling:Global Max Pooling: Takes the maximum value across the entire feature map.Global Average Pooling: Computes the average of all values in the feature map.Global Pooling using Keras:\nPython\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalMaxPooling2D, GlobalAveragePooling2D\nfeature_map = np.array([\n[1, 3, 2, 9],\n[5, 6, 1, 7],\n[4, 2, 8, 6],\n[3, 5, 7, 2]\n], dtype=np.float32).reshape(1, 4, 4, 1)\n# Applying global max pooling\ngm_pool = GlobalMaxPooling2D()\ngm_output = gm_pool(feature_map)\n# Applying global average pooling\nga_pool = GlobalAveragePooling2D()\nga_output = ga_pool(feature_map)\nprint(\"Global Max Pooling Output:\", gm_output.numpy())\nprint(\"Global Average Pooling Output:\", ga_output.numpy())\nOutput:  Global Max Pooling Output: [[9]]Global Average Pooling Output: [[4.4375]]How Pooling Layers Work?Define a Pooling Window (Filter): The size of the pooling window (e.g., 2x2) is chosen, along with a stride (the step size by which the window moves). A common choice is a 2x2 window with a stride of 2, which reduces the feature map size by half.Slide the Window Over the Input: The pooling operation is applied to each region of the input feature map covered by the window.Apply the Pooling Operation: Depending on the type of pooling (max, average, etc.), the operation extracts the required value from each window.Output the Downsampled Feature Map: The result is a smaller feature map that retains the most important information.Key Factors to Consider for Optimizing Pooling Layer Pooling Window Size: The size of the pooling window affects the degree of downsampling. A larger window results in more aggressive downsampling but may lose important details.Stride: The stride determines how much the pooling window moves at each step. A larger stride results in greater dimensionality reduction.Padding: In some cases, padding is used to ensure that the pooling operation covers the entire input feature map.Advantages of Pooling LayerDimensionality reduction: Pooling layer helps in reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This reduces the computational cost and also helps in avoiding overfitting by reducing the number of parameters in the model.Translation invariance: Pooling layers are useful in achieving translation invariance in the feature maps. This means that the position of an object in the image does not affect the classification result, as the same features are detected regardless of the position of the object.Feature selection: Pooling layers help in selecting the most important features from the input, as max pooling selects the most salient features and average pooling provides a balanced representation. Disadvantages of Pooling LayersInformation Loss: Pooling reduces spatial resolution, which can lead to a loss of important fine details.Over-smoothing: Excessive pooling may blur out crucial features.Hyperparameter Tuning: The choice of pooling size and stride affects performance and requires careful tuning.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nCIFAR-10 Image Classification in TensorFlow\nS\nsavyakhosla\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nNeural Network\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nSimilar Reads\nDeep Learning Tutorial  Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to learn from large datasets using multi-layered neural networks.

Improved SafetyApplications of AI in RoboticsReal-Life Applications of AI-Powered RobotsWhat is Robotics?Robotics is a field that deals with the creation and designing of these mechanical humans. And robotics these days is not only restricted to the mechanical and electronics domain. Nowadays, the artificial intelligence robot is becoming 'smarter' and more efficient with the help of computer science.Role of Robotics in Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence has played a very major role not only in increasing the comforts of humans but also by increasing industrial productivity, which includes quantitative as well as qualitative production and cost-efficiency. An artificial intelligence robot can significantly enhance these benefits by integrating advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities. Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are closely related fields, and when combined, they give rise to a discipline known as robotic artificial intelligence or simply \"robotics in artificial intelligence.\"Robotics in AI involves integrating AI technologies into robotic systems to enhance their capabilities and enable them to perform more complex tasks.AI in robotics allows robots to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and make decisions based on data from sensors. This can involve machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and other AI techniques.Robots can use machine learning algorithms to analyze data, recognize patterns, and improve their performance over time. This is particularly useful for tasks where the environment is dynamic or unpredictable.AI-powered vision systems enable robots to interpret and understand visual information from the surroundings. This is crucial for tasks like object recognition, navigation, and manipulation. The combination of robotics and AI opens up a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, drones, industrial automation, healthcare robots, and more. The synergy between these fields continues to advance, leading to increasingly sophisticated and capable robotic systems.How AI is used in Robotics?AI plays a crucial role in modern robotics, bringing intelligence and adaptability to these fascinating machines. An Artificial Intelligence Robot is a perfect example of how AI enhances the capabilities of robots, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks with increased autonomy and adaptability. There are several ways in which an Artificial Intelligence Robot utilizes AI in robotics:Computer VisionObject Recognition: AI-powered computer vision allows robots to recognize and identify objects in their environment. Computer vision helps robots understand their surroundings, create maps, and navigate through complex environments. This is essential for autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots operating in unstructured spaces. Visual serving: AI allows robots to track and precisely manipulate objects based on visual feedback, crucial for tasks like welding, painting, or assembling delicate components.AI algorithms process camera and sensor data to map surroundings, identify obstacles, and plan safe and efficient paths for robots to navigate.Natural Language Processing (NLP)Human-robot interaction: Robots can understand and respond to natural language commands, enabling more intuitive and collaborative interactions with humans.Voice control: Robots can be controlled through voice commands, making them accessible for a wider range of users.Sentiment analysis: AI can analyze human text and speech to understand emotions and adjust robot behavior accordingly.Machine LearningAutonomous decision-making: AI algorithms can learn from data and make decisions in real-time, enabling robots to adapt to changing environments and react to unexpected situations.Reinforcement learning: Robots can learn motor skills and control strategies through trial and error, allowing them to perform complex tasks like walking, running, or playing games.Predictive maintenance: AI can analyze sensor data to predict equipment failures and schedule preventive maintenance, reducing downtime and costs.How do Robots and Artificial Intelligence work together?The answer is simple. An artificial intelligence robot, or AI robot, gives robots a computer vision to navigate, sense, and calculate their reactions accordingly. Artificial intelligence robots learn to perform their tasks from humans through machine learning, which is a part of computer programming and AI. Since the time self-driving cars coined the term Artificial Intelligence in 1956, it has created a lot of sensation. This is because an artificial intelligence robot has the power to give life to robots and empower them to take their decisions on their own. Depending on the use and the tasks that the robot has to perform, different types of AI are used. They are as follows:1. Weak AIWeak AI, also known as Narrow AI is a type of AI is used to create a simulation of human thought and interaction. The robots have predefined commands and responses. However, the robots do not understand the commands they do only the work of retrieving the appropriate response when the suitable command is given. The most suitable example of this is Siri and Alexa.The AI in these devices only executes the tasks as demanded by the owner.2. Strong Artificial IntelligenceStrong Artificial Intelligence is a type of AI is used in those robots who perform their tasks on their own. They do not need any kind of supervision once they are programmed to do the task correctly. This type of AI is widely used nowadays as many of the things are becoming automated and one of the most interesting examples is self-driving cars and internet carsThis type of AI is also used in humanoid robots, which can sense their environment quite well and interact with their surroundings. Also, robotic surgeons are becoming popular day by day as there is no human intervention required at all.3. Specialized Artificial IntelligenceSpecialized artificial intelligence is used when the robot needs to perform only specified special tasks. It is restricted only to limited tasks. This includes mainly industrial robots which perform specified and repetitive tasks like painting, tightening, etc.Benefits of AI in Robotics Benefits of AI in RoboticsAI has already been adopted in robotics, establishing a new generation of intelligent robots that can go farther. These artificial intelligence robots provide flexibility in all sectors of industries, changing the way we interact with technology.1. Enhanced CapabilitiesComplex Task Execution: AI algorithms help robots perform highly detailed tasks that could not have been executed directly through their coding. This may involve perception, manipulation, and decision-making abilities in environments that are complex and constantly changing. For instance, robots are now able to do operations, make intricate part jointery, and traverse unknown territory.Improved Learning and Adaptation: Machine learning enables robots to learn autonomously from data and improves their knowledge in the process. It help them to cope with new conditions, to increase speed and efficiency of their work, and use their knowledge of possible difficulties in advance. Consider an autonomous vehicle which operates in a warehouse and figures out the best path through the facility based on the dynamic information it gets.2. Increased Efficiency and ProductivityAutomation of Repetitive Tasks: AI, for instance, can use robots to manage many activities that are boring and time consuming to relieve workers’ burden. This automation results in higher efficiency and better time usage across numerous industries, including production and supply chain processes.Reduced Errors and Improved Accuracy: It proactively reduces chances of errors associated with fatigue or perhaps inherent human limitations when compared to similarly programmed Artificial Intelligence algorithms that are capable of shallow data analysis and precise calculations. This definitively increases general process productivity and product quality.3. Improved SafetyOperation in Hazardous Environments: Because robots that use artificial intelligence can be used in risky areas such as power plant or a scene of disaster. It can also do important work without costing human lives; these robots can.Enhanced Human-Robot Collaboration: AI can bring working synergistically alongside with humans as well as robots is safe and efficient. Some examples of robotic applications include repetitive, time-consuming, or physically demanding operations where human fatigue might be an issue; operations that humans do better, because of their flexibility, creativity, and ability to make decisions.Applications of AI in RoboticsAI in robotics is transforming industries by enabling robots to autonomously perform tasks that were once reliant on human intervention.

We round up the main talking points...\nMonday 14 July 2025 15:17, UK\nSerious business for competing clubs\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nCole Palmer and Reece James give their thoughts on US President Donald Trump joining the Chelsea squad for the Club World Cup trophy lift\nIt was clear right from the start of the tournament that the clubs involved were taking the competition seriously. Despite European cynicism in the build-up - and during, courtesy of Jurgen Klopp - it turned out to be more than an end-of-season inconvenience.\nThe big European teams generally fielded their strongest possible line-ups and there was a rush to recruit new signings in time for the tournament, with FIFA eager to point out that 59 new players were registered by participating clubs in the early June transfer window, at a total cost of $480 million (£356m).\nWinners Chelsea hit the jackpot\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol explains how Chelsea won the Club World Cup and how Donald Trump, Robbie Williams and Coldplay were also centre stage\nIt helped, of course, that the financial rewards on offer were so lucrative. Chelsea are estimated to have earned £85m by winning the competition, according to Sky Sports News, with runners-up Paris Saint-Germain banking £78.4m.In total, FIFA's prize pot shared between 32 competing clubs was £774m ($1bn). Every club received a participation fee of up to £28m depending on their confederation, ensuring that even those knocked out at the group stage left better off. Manchester City made £38m despite being eliminated in the round of 16.\nUltimately, money talks. In an age of financial fair play and PSR, the financial rewards on offer won out over player welfare and fatigue concerns. Four years from now, you can be sure that club owners and executives from across the footballing world will be eager for a slice of the pie when the competition returns.\nLow crowds provide talking pointLow attendances became a source of embarrassment to FIFA in the early stages of the tournament, particularly when Chelsea played their opening game against LAFC in front of just 22,137 fans at the 71,000-capacity Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\nAlso See:\nStream Sky Sports on NOW\nDownload the Sky Sports App\nGet Sky Sports on WhatsApp!\nLive football on Sky Sports this week\nImage:\nThe Mercedes-Benz Stadium was less than a third full for Chelsea's opening game\nThere were many more fixtures played out in sparsely-attended stadia, with four matches failing to even draw crowds of 10,000. Others, though, were more popular, with 16 games, including Sunday's sold-out final, attracting at least 60,000 fans.FIFA pointed to kick-off times, ticket prices and weather (more on that later) as factors in the low attendances but the numbers did pick up as the tournament progressed, with over two and a half million tickets sold in total and an average attendance of 39,705, the increases partly down to dynamic pricing which allowed fans to gain entry to some games for as little as £8.\nImage:\nWydad Casablanca fans pack out a stand in their group-stage game against Man City\nWhile far from spectacular for a 63-game tournament, the overall numbers were enough for FIFA to trumpet the competition's appeal in its expanded format. There seems little doubt it is here to stay.Weather delays a cause for concernSweltering heat was an issue throughout the tournament. As temperatures soared, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said it was \"impossible\" to have a normal training session while midfielder Enzo Fernandez said it was \"very dangerous\" to play in the conditions.Fernandez also argued, with some justification, that the spectacle was affected. \"The speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow,\" he added.\nImage:\nChelsea's round of 16 game against Benfica in Charlotte was suspended for two hours\nThe extreme weather caused farcical scenes as a string of matches had to be delayed and suspended, including Chelsea's round of 16 win over Benfica, which featured a two-hour hiatus, when players and fans were told to seek shelter because of lightning in the area.The weather issues were of course particularly concerning given the US is hosting next year's World Cup, along with Mexico and Canada. FIFA president Gianni Infantino sought to downplay those worries by saying games with daytime kick-offs designed European audiences will take place in covered stadia.Brazilian clubs seize chance to impressChelsea and Paris Saint-Germain ensured the final was a European affair but some representatives from the rest of the world made a mark too. Saudi outfit Al Hilal held Real Madrid and beat Manchester City. Collectively, the Brazilian clubs were the most impressive.All four of Flamengo, Botafogo, Palmeiras and Fluminense made it to the knockout stages, with the latter two reaching the quarter-finals and semis respectively. Three of the four enjoyed memorable wins over prestigious European opponents along the way.\nImage:\nPalmeiras reached the quarter-finals\nImage:\nFlamengo beat Chelsea 3-1 in the group stage\nBotafogo were the one of only two teams, along with Chelsea, to beat Paris Saint-Germain with their 1-0 group-stage victory, while Flamengo secured a 3-1 win over the eventual champions and Fluminense saw off Inter 2-0 in the round of 16.Their performances, cheered on by large and colourful contingents of travelling fans, highlighted the quality of their league and provided a source of pride to a Brazilian public whose domestic stars rarely get an opportunity to shine on a global stage.Trump, a half-time show and player 'walk-ons'\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\nHighlights of the FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain\nIt is fair to say the 'Americanisation' of certain aspects of the tournament was met with mixed reviews. The final had the look and feel of the Superbowl, with lengthy pre-match and half-time shows. There was even a fighter-jet fly-past.US president Donald Trump was eager to place himself front and centre in Sunday's final, watching on with Infantino at the MetLife Stadium and later gatecrashing Chelsea's celebrations, to the bemusement of match-winner Cole Palmer.\nThroughout the tournament, there were also WWE-style 'walk-ons', which involved all 22 starters in every game being individually announced over the loudspeaker instead of emerging from the tunnel together in the traditional way.Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia was a fan, saying: \"It's a bit of a showbiz thing, isn't it?\" and adding that he would like to see it in the Premier League. But others felt differently, with the lengthy process frustrating many fans at home and delaying kick-offs.Will fatigue come back to bite Man City, Chelsea and others?Their finances look healthy following the tournament. Chelsea fans will relish holding the title of world champions for four years. But will competing clubs' performances suffer next season as a result of the extra Club World Cup workload?\"I try not to think about it, otherwise I will be so anxious,\" said Pep Guardiola last month. Manchester City's round of 16 exit against Al-Hilal was their 61st game of the season in all competitions.\"Maybe in November, December, January, ask me,\" added Guardiola. \"I may say 'So listen, we are a disaster. We are exhausted. The World Cup destroyed us.'\"It is a worry for Chelsea too, given they played even more games than Manchester City at 64.With the Premier League kick-off only a month away, they will be desperately hoping England boss Thomas Tuchel, who predicted the tournament will give Liverpool and Arsenal a \"huge\" advantage next term, is not proved right. But the true ramifications might only become clear later in the campaign.\nACCAFREEZE WITH SKY BET\nAccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!\nAround Sky\nOther Sports\nUpgrade to Sky Sports\nOther Sports\nNot got Sky?

It’s used in machine learning for tasks like classification and prediction. In this article, we’ll see more about Decision Trees, their types and other core concepts.A Decision Tree helps us make decisions by showing different options and how they are related. It has a tree-like structure that starts with one main question called the root node which represents the entire dataset. From there, the tree branches out into different possibilities based on features in the data.Root Node: Starting point representing the whole dataset.Branches: Lines connecting nodes showing the flow from one decision to another.Internal Nodes: Points where decisions are made based on data features.Leaf Nodes: End points of the tree where the final decision or prediction is made.Decision TreeA Decision Tree also helps with decision-making by showing possible outcomes clearly. By looking at the \"branches\" we can quickly compare options and figure out the best choice.There are mainly two types of Decision Trees based on the target variable:Classification Trees: Used for predicting categorical outcomes like spam or not spam. These trees split the data based on features to classify data into predefined categories.Regression Trees: Used for predicting continuous outcomes like predicting house prices. Instead of assigning categories, it provides numerical predictions based on the input features.How Decision Trees Work?1. Start with the Root Node: It begins with a main question at the root node which is derived from the dataset’s features.2. Ask Yes/No Questions: From the root, the tree asks a series of yes/no questions to split the data into subsets based on specific attributes.3. Branching Based on Answers: Each question leads to different branches:If the answer is yes, the tree follows one path.If the answer is no, the tree follows another path.4. Continue Splitting: This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step.5. Reach the Leaf Node: The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made.Let’s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time:1. In the morning: It asks “Tired?”If yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee.If no, it says no coffee is needed.2. In the afternoon: It asks again “Tired?”If yes, it suggests drinking coffee.If no, no coffee is needed.ExampleSplitting Criteria in Decision TreesIn a Decision Tree, the process of splitting data at each node is important. The splitting criteria finds the best feature to split the data on. Common splitting criteria include Gini Impurity and Entropy.Gini Impurity: This criterion measures how \"impure\" a node is. The lower the Gini Impurity the better the feature splits the data into distinct categories.Entropy: This measures the amount of uncertainty or disorder in the data. The tree tries to reduce the entropy by splitting the data on features that provide the most information about the target variable.These criteria help decide which features are useful for making the best split at each decision point in the tree.Pruning in Decision TreesPruning is an important technique used to prevent overfitting in Decision Trees. Overfitting occurs when a tree becomes too deep and starts to memorize the training data rather than learning general patterns. This leads to poor performance on new, unseen data.This technique reduces the complexity of the tree by removing branches that have little predictive power. It improves model performance by helping the tree generalize better to new data. It also makes the model simpler and faster to deploy.It is useful when a Decision Tree is too deep and starts to capture noise in the data.Advantages of Decision TreesEasy to Understand: Decision Trees are visual which makes it easy to follow the decision-making process.Versatility: Can be used for both classification and regression problems.No Need for Feature Scaling: Unlike many machine learning models, it don’t require us to scale or normalize our data.Handles Non-linear Relationships: It capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and outcomes effectively.Interpretability: The tree structure is easy to interpret helps in allowing users to understand the reasoning behind each decision.Handles Missing Data: It can handle missing values by using strategies like assigning the most common value or ignoring missing data during splits.Disadvantages of Decision TreesOverfitting: They can overfit the training data if they are too deep which means they memorize the data instead of learning general patterns. This leads to poor performance on unseen data.Instability: It can be unstable which means that small changes in the data may lead to significant differences in the tree structure and predictions.Bias towards Features with Many Categories: It can become biased toward features with many distinct values which focuses too much on them and potentially missing other important features which can reduce prediction accuracy.Difficulty in Capturing Complex Interactions: Decision Trees may struggle to capture complex interactions between features which helps in making them less effective for certain types of data.Computationally Expensive for Large Datasets: For large datasets, building and pruning a Decision Tree can be computationally intensive, especially as the tree depth increases.Applications of Decision TreesDecision Trees are used across various fields due to their simplicity, interpretability and versatility lets see some key applications:Loan Approval in Banking: Banks use Decision Trees to assess whether a loan application should be approved. The decision is based on factors like credit score, income, employment status and loan history. This helps predict approval or rejection helps in enabling quick and reliable decisions.Medical Diagnosis: In healthcare they assist in diagnosing diseases. For example, they can predict whether a patient has diabetes based on clinical data like glucose levels, BMI and blood pressure. This helps classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories, supporting early diagnosis and treatment.Predicting Exam Results in Education: Educational institutions use  to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on factors like attendance, study time and past grades. This helps teachers identify at-risk students and offer targeted support.Customer Churn Prediction: Companies use Decision Trees to predict whether a customer will leave or stay based on behavior patterns, purchase history, and interactions. This allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers.Fraud Detection: In finance, Decision Trees are used to detect fraudulent activities, such as credit card fraud. By analyzing past transaction data and patterns, Decision Trees can identify suspicious activities and flag them for further investigation.A decision tree can also be used to help build automated predictive models which have applications in machine learning, data mining and statistics. By mastering Decision Trees, we can gain a deeper understanding of data and make more informed decisions across different fields.If you want to learn that refer to related article:Python | Decision tree implementation How To Build Decision Tree in MATLAB?\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nDecision Tree Classifiers in R Programming\nS\nsaloni1297\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learning\nSimilar Reads\nDecision Theory in AI Decision theory is a foundational concept in Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling machines to make rational and informed decisions based on available data.

Traditional machine learning models require large labeled datasets to recognize classes accurately. However, zero-shot learning (ZSL) introduces a paradigm shift by enabling models to recognize unseen classes without requiring direct training on them. A key breakthrough in this domain is the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, which leverages both text and image data for better generalization. In this article, we will explore zero-shot learning, novel class recognition, and how the CLIP model addresses these challenges effectively.What is Zero-Shot Learning?Zero-shot learning refers to the capability of a model to classify unseen classes without having explicit examples of them during training. Instead of learning from the labeled dataset, zero-shot learning relies on semantic information, such as descriptions of new classes, to recognize them. This is a significant leap from traditional supervised learning, where models are only as good as the data they are trained on.In a zero-shot learning scenario, the model is provided with knowledge about the attributes of the new class (like textual descriptions, context, or relationships to other classes) that helps in the classification process. This is especially useful in applications like object recognition, where it's impractical to collect and label data for every possible class.Example of Zero-Shot LearningImagine a model trained to recognize dogs, cats, and birds. In a zero-shot setting, when the model encounters an image of a horse (which it has never seen before), it can use a textual description like \"a four-legged animal often used for riding\" to correctly classify the image as a horse.Novel Class Recognition with Zero-Shot LearningNovel class recognition is a subset of zero-shot learning where the model is exposed to completely new categories that were not part of the training data. This requires the model to learn discriminative features from a predefined set of training classes and generalize these features to novel or unseen classes.The traditional approach to classifying novel classes requires additional fine-tuning on the new classes, but zero-shot learning enables the model to bypass this step. By using semantic relationships between classes (such as descriptive text or attributes), the model can effectively distinguish between seen and unseen classes.CLIP Model: A Game-Changer for Zero-Shot LearningThe Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, introduced by OpenAI, represents a significant advancement in zero-shot learning. Unlike traditional deep learning models that are limited to a fixed set of output classes, CLIP can generalize to new tasks and classes by combining image and text embeddings.How CLIP WorksCLIP is built on the idea of aligning images and text into a shared latent space. The key innovation here is that CLIP learns to understand the relationship between textual descriptions and corresponding images. During training, it uses a contrastive learning approach: matching image embeddings with their respective textual descriptions while pushing apart embeddings of mismatched pairs.This pretraining on large datasets of image-text pairs enables CLIP to perform zero-shot classification. Given an image of an unseen class, the model can compare it against possible textual descriptions of classes, even if it has never encountered the class directly.For instance, if CLIP has never seen a zebra, it can still recognize one if given a descriptive prompt such as \"an animal with black and white stripes.\"Benefits of CLIP for Zero-Shot LearningGeneralization Across Domains: CLIP's text-image alignment allows it to generalize not only to new classes but also across different tasks. Whether it’s object classification, style transfer, or action recognition, CLIP has demonstrated impressive flexibility.No Need for Task-Specific Training: Traditional models often require fine-tuning or retraining on new datasets to handle novel classes. CLIP bypasses this limitation by using textual descriptions as anchors for classification. Thus, there is no need for collecting and labeling new data every time a new class is introduced.Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Capabilities: CLIP is designed for both few-shot and zero-shot learning, making it versatile across applications that demand minimal training data.Architecture of CLIPCLIP consists of two main components:Image Encoder: CLIP uses a vision model (typically a ResNet or Vision Transformer) to generate image embeddings from raw image inputs.Text Encoder: A transformer-based model processes text and generates corresponding text embeddings.Both embeddings are then mapped into a shared latent space where the model can compute similarity scores between text and image representations, enabling it to classify images based on text descriptions.Harnessing CLIP for Zero-Shot Learning in Novel Class RecognitionHere's how to leverage the CLIP model for zero-shot learning in image classification.Step 1: Install Required LibrariesBefore you begin, ensure that the necessary Python libraries are installed. These include the transformers library, which provides access to the CLIP model, as well as torch and pillow for handling image data and deep learning operations.!pip install transformers torch pillowStep 2: Import LibrariesImport the necessary Python libraries. The transformers library provides the CLIP model and processor, while PIL (Pillow) is used for opening and manipulating images.from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModelfrom PIL import Imageimport torchStep 3: Load the Pre-trained CLIP ModelLoad a pre-trained instance of the CLIP model from OpenAI's model hub. This model has been trained on a variety of images and their descriptions, making it capable of generalizing from text to unseen visual content.model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")Step 4: Upload an ImageUpload an image to be classified. You can use a direct file path if you're working locally, or use a feature like Colab's upload feature if you're working in a notebook environment.image = Image.open(\"/content/dog.jpg\")Step 5: Define Class LabelsDefine a list of text descriptions that represent the classes you're interested in classifying. These labels are used by the CLIP model to compare against the image.labels = [\"a photo of a dog\", \"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a car\"]Step 6: Preprocess the InputsUse the CLIPProcessor to convert the image and text labels into a format suitable for the model, including any necessary padding and tensor transformations.inputs = processor(text=labels, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)Step 7: Perform Zero-Shot ClassificationPass the processed inputs to the CLIP model. The model outputs logits representing the similarity between the image and each label. These are then converted into probabilities to understand the model's confidence across the defined classes.outputs = model(**inputs)logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Similarity scoreprobs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)      # Probability distributionStep 8: Get the Predicted ClassDetermine the predicted class by finding the label with the highest probability. This step concludes the classification process, providing a zero-shot learning-based prediction.predicted_class = labels[probs.argmax()]print(f\"Predicted class: {predicted_class}\")Complete Code You can download the image of the dog from here.\nPython\n# Step 1: Install Required Libraries\n!pip install transformers torch pillow\n# Step 2: Import Libraries\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\n# Step 3: Load the Pre-trained CLIP Model\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\n# Step 4: Upload an Image (We used Colab's upload feature or provide a path)\nimage = Image.open(\"/content/dog.jpg\")\n# Step 5: Define Class Labels (Text descriptions)\nlabels = [\"a photo of a dog\", \"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a car\"]\n# Step 6: Preprocess the Inputs\ninputs = processor(text=labels, images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\n# Step 7: Perform Zero-Shot Classification\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Similarity score\nprobs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)      # Probability distribution\n# Step 8: Get the Predicted Class\npredicted_class = labels[probs.argmax()]\nprint(f\"Predicted class: {predicted_class}\")\nOutput: Predicted class: a photo of a dogApplication of CLIP in Novel Class RecognitionZero-shot learning using CLIP can be highly impactful in various industries. Some notable applications include:Healthcare: In medical diagnostics, CLIP can identify rare diseases or conditions without needing large datasets of labeled medical images. By using descriptions of symptoms or conditions, it can recognize unseen medical images and assist in diagnosis.E-commerce: CLIP enables retailers to categorize new products based on textual descriptions alone, without the need for explicit training on every new product. This can streamline inventory management and recommendation systems.Autonomous Vehicles: CLIP’s ability to generalize to unseen objects can improve the safety of autonomous systems by allowing them to identify unfamiliar obstacles on the road.Content Moderation: With its zero-shot capabilities, CLIP can be employed in moderating user-generated content across platforms. By leveraging descriptions of inappropriate content, the model can flag potentially harmful images without prior training on explicit examples.Challenges and LimitationsWhile CLIP demonstrates powerful zero-shot capabilities, it’s not without its limitations:Bias and Fairness: Since CLIP is trained on large, web-crawled datasets, it can inherit biases present in the data. This may lead to biased classification or harmful outcomes in critical applications like healthcare or law enforcement.Contextual Misinterpretation: CLIP sometimes struggles with understanding nuanced contexts in images. For example, it may incorrectly associate an image with a textual description if the context isn't clear.Dependence on Textual Descriptions: The quality of CLIP’s predictions relies heavily on the richness and accuracy of the text descriptions provided. Poor or ambiguous descriptions may lead to inaccurate classifications.ConclusionZero-shot learning, enabled by models like CLIP, represents a revolutionary step forward in the field of machine learning. By leveraging both images and textual descriptions, CLIP allows for the recognition of unseen classes, eliminating the need for extensive labeled datasets and task-specific fine-tuning. The potential applications across industries are vast, from healthcare diagnostics to autonomous systems, but challenges like bias and contextual misinterpretation need to be addressed for widespread adoption. As we continue to refine models like CLIP, the future of zero-shot learning looks promising, opening up new possibilities for artificial intelligence in real-world applications.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nMulti-class classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)\nB\nbug8wdqo\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nSimilar Reads\nZero-Shot Text Classification using HuggingFace Model Zero-shot text classification is a groundbreaking technique that allows for categorizing text into predefined labels without any prior training on those specific labels.

It can be primary (idiopathic) with no known cause, or secondary (comorbid), relating to another health condition.Onset insomnia: If you have difficulty falling asleep, you may have onset insomnia. Trouble getting to sleep might result from caffeine use, mental health symptoms, or other common insomnia triggers, but it can also develop with other sleep disorders.Maintenance insomnia occurs when you have trouble remaining asleep once you get to sleep or consistently wake up too early. This type of insomnia might relate to underlying health and mental health symptoms, but lying awake and worrying you won’t get enough sleep can make it worse.Behavioral insomnia of childhood: Doctors diagnose this type of insomnia in children who have consistent trouble falling asleep, refusal to go to bed, or both. Children with this condition often benefit from learning self-soothing strategies and following a regular sleep routine.Insomnia causes and risk factorsCauses of insomnia can vary depending on which type you have.Possible causes of acute insomnia are recent stressors, such as an upsetting or traumatic event or jet lag.Chronic insomnia can occur as a result of:chronic pain conditions, such as arthritis or back painpsychological conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or substance use disorderssleep apnea and other sleep disordershealth conditions such as diabetes or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)Risk factors for insomniaInsomnia is related to age, sex, and genetics.

They may also ask you to keep an app-based or written sleep log for 2 to 4 weeks, tracking:what time you go to bedthe approximate time it takes you to fall asleepany instances of repeated waking in the nightwhat time you wake up each dayThey may order medical tests or blood work to help rule out medical conditions that can interfere with sleep.If they suspect you could have an underlying sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea, they may recommend a sleep study.You’ll likely receive a clinical diagnosis of insomnia if your sleep difficulties occur at least 3 nights a week for a minimum of 3 months and if they create major distress or difficulties in your daily life.Treating insomniaYou have several options for treating insomnia, including therapy, medications, supplements, and natural remedies.Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends CBT-I as a first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults.With support from a therapist, you can learn specific techniques to address insomnia, including:Stimulus control: teaches you to get out of bed and find a quiet and relaxing activity until you feel sleepy, limiting the time you may lie awake and worry about falling asleepSleep restriction: restricts and then gradually increases the amount of time you spend in bedBright light therapy: exposes you to bright light in the morning or evening, depending on whether you have more trouble falling asleep or staying asleepA therapist may also offer guidance on relaxation techniques and sleep hygiene practices that address behaviors that prevent you from getting quality sleep.A therapist can also identify underlying mental health symptoms contributing to insomnia or making your symptoms worse. Addressing these triggers and contributing factors can go a long way toward relieving insomnia.Medications and supplementsYour clinician might prescribe medication (or Z-drugs) if therapy and lifestyle changes don’t work. Example medications include:eszopiclone (Lunesta)zolpidem (Ambien)triazolam (Halcion)They may recommend a medication in combination with therapy with the goal of ultimately sleeping without medication.Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements like melatonin can offer some relief from insomnia. Melatonin supplements may slightly decrease the time it takes you to fall asleep.Support for melatonin as an insomnia treatment remains inconclusive. Experts have yet to confirm whether it’s safe to use melatonin long term, though it’s generally considered safe for short-term use.Check in with a healthcare professional before trying supplements like melatonin or OTC medications to help ease insomnia. These medications may interact with other prescription and OTC medications or cause side effects.If you’re pregnant, always ask your healthcare team before taking any medications or supplements. Other approachesLifestyle changes and home remedies can often help manage insomnia symptoms. You can try:Natural sleep aids: Before bed, try warm milk, herbal tea, or valerian. Relaxing essential oil aromatherapy using oils like lavender and peppermint may also offer some sleep benefits.Meditation: Promote relaxation with mindful meditation. It improves sleep quality and relieves stress, which might contribute to insomnia. Many apps can help you start meditation.Acupuncture: Many people find this traditional Chinese medicine technique helpful for easing insomnia symptoms.Exercise: At least 30 minutes of regular exercise can help you fall asleep and improve the quality of your sleep by releasing melatonin.»More:Shop our expert-verified products for achieving deeper sleep.Insomnia complicationsYour brain can’t carry out important functions that keep it running smoothly when you don’t get enough sleep.

Frequent, vivid dreams may be related to stress, medications, sleep disorders, or early pregnancy.While we think of sleep as a time for recharging the body, the brain is actually quite active during sleep — dreaming. Our dreams can be soothing or scary, mysterious or helpful, and realistic or fantastical.Sometimes we wake up and have no idea that we’ve dreamed, while other times, we can closely recall our dreams because they were so intense. These are known as vivid dreams.What causes vivid dreams?Brain scientists aren’t sure why humans dream in the first place, but they think it has something to do with memory.Dreaming might help the brain eliminate any unnecessary information or memories while processing and storing what’s important. Some people feel more refreshed after having slept and dreamed, even if they do not remember dreaming.People are most likely to remember the last dream they had in their sleep cycle. But it’s possible to remember a vivid dream long after it’s occurred if it seemed very intense.Vivid dreams can be positive or negative, realistic or fantasy. Scientists know that most heavy dreaming occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep normally cycles every 90 minutes during a night of sleep and may last 20 to 25 minutes.About 25% of an adult’s night of sleep is spent in REM cycles. The average adult should get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night for optimal health. That’s a lot of time for dreaming!So, what causes vivid dreams? Scientists aren’t completely sure. But they think the following factors may play a part.Stress or anxietyDifficulties real and imagined can cause a person to experience stress and anxiety in their daily life. Problems with friends, family, school, or work can trigger intense dreams as can big events like getting married or buying a house.Stressed caused by traumatic events, such as a death of a loved one, sexual abuse, or a car accident can also cause vivid dreams. Anxiety, in particular, is associated with an increased risk of disturbing and intense nightmares.Sleep disordersSleeping issues that cause a lack of sleep, such as insomnia and narcolepsy, can increase one’s risk of experiencing vivid dreams.Changes to your sleep schedule, such as flying overseas (and going to sleep at a different time) or getting less sleep than usual, can also increase this risk.MedicationsThere are some medications that have been reported to contribute to vivid dreams. These medications include many antidepressants, beta blockers, blood pressure medications, Parkinson’s disease drugs, and drugs to stop smoking.Substance abuseUsing alcohol in excess, using recreational drugs, or experiencing a withdrawal from drugs can trigger vivid dreams, often nightmares.Other health disordersIn addition to stress and anxiety, other mental health conditions, such as depression and schizophrenia, are associated with vivid dreams. Physical illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, have also been associated with vivid dreams.Early pregnancyPregnancy can trigger changes in the body’s hormone levels, sleep patterns, and emotions. Many pregnant women say they experience vivid dreams, especially during the early days of their pregnancy. What are the side effects of vivid dreams?Normally, vivid dreams are nothing to worry about. Sometimes they may only affect you during a certain part of your life.But negative vivid dreams, especially if they last for weeks or months, can be emotionally disturbing and disruptive to your sleep. And that can cause health problems.Some common side effects of vivid dreams include:Daytime sleepiness. This can cause concentration and memory problems that can affect your productivity at school or work. It can even affect your ability to carry out everyday tasks, such as driving or taking a shower. Even the smallest tasks can become dangerous if you get distracted.Mood problems. Vivid dreams can be emotionally draining, causing depression or anxiety symptoms. This can be an especially concerning problem if your vivid dreams persist over time.Resisting sleep. You may find that you consciously or subconsciously avoid going to bed or falling asleep because you fear you’ll have another bad dream.Suicidal attempts or thinking. Some people have reported suicidal thoughts (ideation) secondary to troubling dreams. This is extremely serious. If you have attempted or are considering suicide, get help from a crisis or suicide prevention hotline. Try the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255. It’s important to get help right away.National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8244If you or someone you know is considering suicide, call the number above or text TALK to 741741 to text with a trained crisis counselor for free, 24/7. Remember, you are not alone. Treatment and support can help. How are vivid dreams treated?It isn’t always possible to pinpoint an exact cause of vivid dreams. In many cases, these dreams will go away over time.But if your vivid dreams are causing you emotional distress or physical problems, you might benefit from medical treatment or lifestyle modifications.Schedule an appointment with your doctor or a sleep specialist to try to determine what treatments or lifestyle modifications are right for you.Here are some of the common treatments for vivid dreams.Medical intervention. If your vivid dreams are caused by an underlying mental or physical health condition, talk with a doctor about diagnosing and treating that condition. Most doctors don’t recommend use of medication to treat vivid dreams. However, in the case of nightmares induced by trauma, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a doctor may consider prescribing sleeping medication or anti-anxiety medication to help induce sleep.Image rehearsal therapy. This treatment therapy, done with a mental healthcare professional, involves changing the ending to a vivid dream or nightmare you remember when you’re awake until it no longer becomes threatening. Your mental healthcare provider will ask you to continue playing over the new, nonthreatening ending to the dream in your mind. This therapy is designed to reduce a person’s frequency of vivid dreams — especially nightmares.Staying healthy. Eating well, maintaining a healthy weight, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, drinking enough water, and looking after your mental health can help prevent vivid dreams.Coping with stress and anxiety. Everyone experiences stress and anxiety, but some people are better at coping with it than others. If you feel that your stress and anxiety levels are out of control, you might want to consider: meditationdeep breathingrelaxation techniquesart therapyexerciseother activities that can ease your stressFrequently asked questions about vivid dreamsWhy am I suddenly dreaming so vividly?Scientists are entirely sure what causes vivid dreams, but they believe the following factors may play a role:stress or anxietysleep disorderscertain medicationsearly pregnancysubstance abusemental health conditions (such as depression or schizophrenia)physical health disorders (such as cancer or heart disease)Do vivid dreams mean anything?Brain scientists do yet understand why we dream. They have discovered that if you wake up with vivid memories of your dreams, it typically means they occurred during REM sleep. REM sleep is when we tend to dream. The deepest NREM sleep is when the body fully relaxes and repairs itself. Learn about the stages of sleep here.Is it normal to have vivid dreams almost every night?Having a vivid dream every now and then is typically not something to be concerned about. However, if you are having vivid dreams every night, you may want to talk with a doctor to see if there is an underlying condition that might be causing these dreams to occur with such regularity.Do vivid dreams mean good sleep?Generally speaking, dreams you remember (such as vivid dreams), usually occur during REM sleep. But a good night’s sleep typically involves getting the right balance of sleep in each sleep stage. The five stages of sleep are: light NREM sleep, deep NREM sleep, and REM sleep. How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Warwick, RDN, CDCES — Written by Jillian Kubala, MS, RD  on October 27, 2020As a dietitian, I’ve been treating people with autoimmune conditions, including Hashimoto’s disease, for years.Hashimoto’s is the most common type of hypothyroidism in the United States. It’s an autoimmune disease that damages the thyroid, a gland that releases hormones that control metabolism, growth, and a number of other bodily functions.Through my patients, I knew how difficult Hashimoto’s disease could be to diagnose, treat, and manage. However, I had no idea just how much this disease affects physical and mental health until I was diagnosed myself.Here’s my story.Share on PinterestCourtesy of Jillian KubalaVague symptoms I started to feel off in the summer of 2019. I couldn’t sleep, was so tired during the day that I could barely finish my work, and felt hungover every morning even though I wasn’t drinking alcohol at the time.I was also experiencing strange heart flutters, anxiety, brain fog, difficulty concentrating, extreme cold intolerance, joint pain, air hunger (a feeling of shortness of breath), and many other vague symptoms. Over the next several months, I visited a number of specialists, including a cardiologist, pulmonologist, and rheumatologist. Every test came back normal aside from my white blood cell count, which was low. I was also slightly anemic. Side noteSome people with Hashimoto’s disease have normal or only borderline low thyroid values in lab results. That’s because the thyroid destruction that happens during Hashimoto’s disease is intermittent.Some of the doctors I saw were dismissive and chalked my symptoms up to stress and anxiety, which — by the way — is extremely common for people with Hashimoto’s. After hearing several doctors tell me that everything was normal, I thought I was losing my mind. I started to question myself. Were these symptoms seriously caused by stress and anxiety? No. I knew my body, and I knew that something was wrong.Getting a diagnosis can be difficult As a last ditch effort, I made an appointment with an infectious disease doctor because I live on the East End of Long Island, where ticks are abundant. I thought my symptoms could be due to Lyme disease.This doctor ran bloodwork, including a thyroid panel. As a dietitian, I like to review my own results as soon as they’re available. When I saw that my T3 was low, I called an endocrinologist with whom I work closely and made an appointment. She was the one who finally diagnosed me with Hashimoto’s disease after an ultrasound of my thyroid and bloodwork that showed low levels of T3, a thyroid hormone, and elevated thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. Getting a diagnosis took me about 7 months, which is very common for people with Hashimoto’s disease. I was so relieved to get a diagnosis after months of being told that my symptoms were basically all in my head. But I was also worried about my health and resentful about the diagnosis. Aside from having Raynaud’s syndrome, which reduces blood flow to the fingers and toes, and exercise-induced asthma as a kid, I was a healthy person with limitless energy. I took very good care of my health, exercised, didn’t smoke, and grew my own food. However, I knew far too well that autoimmune conditions, as well as serious medical conditions in general, can affect anyone — even people who are physically healthy. My endocrinologist thinks that, in my case, a viral infection triggered my Hashimoto’s disease. She started me on Armour Thyroid, a natural thyroid hormone replacement medication.Side noteAlthough researchers are still unsure about the exact cause of Hashimoto’s, multiple factors, including genetic vulnerability and environmental triggers, are thought to be involved.Feeling better takes timeShare on PinterestCourtesy of Jillian KubalaAfter starting on Armour, I thought I would start feeling better within a few weeks. Yet, although some of my symptoms like severe cold intolerance and joint pain improved, I was still feeling awful after about a month or so on the same dose.Symptoms persisting even with medication is also prevalent among those with Hashimoto’s. Although some people respond well to medication and start feeling like their old selves, others continue experiencing significant symptoms that affect their quality of life even when their thyroid function is considered normal. In fact, many endocrinologists and researchers recognize that symptoms alone aren’t usually used to assess the effectiveness of treatment — laboratory values are. Therefore, medications are prescribed and adjusted based on these values, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Thankfully, my doctor expressed interest in how I was feeling and whether my symptoms were being controlled. She was always open to trying new medications and doses until we found a treatment that made me feel better. When I told her that I was still experiencing significant symptoms, she increased my dosage. After another few weeks, I finally started to feel better and get my energy back.Dietary changes and supplements can help, but they’re not magic pills After starting the initial dose of medication, I also tried dietary and supplement protocols that I had previously encouraged my patients with Hashimoto’s disease to implement. These regimens had worked wonders for some of them — but not all.Like anything else I recommend to my patients, these supplements and protocols are based on scientific research.Side noteIt’s important to work with a dietitian when making changes to your diet or supplement protocol. It’s just as necessary to let your healthcare provider know if you start taking supplements. Experimenting with dietsI first tried the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet, which was shown to improve quality of life and significantly reduce markers of inflammation in people with Hashimoto’s in a 2019 research study. I followed the protocol strictly, but it didn’t significantly improve my symptoms. To be honest, I already ate plant-centric, paleo-style meals for many years before I was diagnosed. Not only did this eating pattern help manage my Raynaud’s syndrome symptoms, but it also made me feel my best.Although I added back certain grains, some cheeses, and legumes, which are eliminated in AIP, I continued to avoid gluten and returned to my normal diet, which consists of plenty of veggies, fruits, healthy fats, and protein sources like fish, eggs, and chicken. As a gluten-free diet has been shown to improve thyroid function and reduce thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s, I suggest that all of my patients with Hashimoto’s try this diet for at least a few months to see if their symptoms and disease markers improve.Experimenting with supplementsFor supplements, I again turned to research to find the most evidence-based approach. Since I had been treating people with Hashimoto’s, I knew that anti-inflammatory supplements like fish oil and certain nutrients like zinc, selenium, and magnesium may be helpful.I also knew that people with Hashimoto’s are more likely to be deficient in certain nutrients like vitamins B12 and D. I was already taking a vitamin D/K2 supplement, B complex vitamin, and magnesium glycinate, so I added in selenium, zinc, and high dose fish oil.Like the dietary changes, these supplements didn’t make me feel significantly better. However, certain beneficial changes can’t be determined solely by how you feel. In general, taking certain supplements and following an anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense diet may improve thyroid function, inflammation, and overall health.Being treated with medication, taking certain supplements, and adhering to a nutrient-dense diet did help me feel better over time. Remember that managing an autoimmune disease is a marathon, not a sprint.Further infoExplore more dietary and supplement tips for Hashimoto’s disease in my comprehensive, science-based article here.What has worked for me Finding the right medication and dosage, following a nutritious diet, and taking supplements have significantly improved my quality of life.Plus, giving my body time to recover was key.When I was first diagnosed, I didn’t have the energy to exercise or do my favorite hobbies like hiking and gardening, so I let myself rest. A lot of guilt and frustration accompanies feeling too unwell to do things that you love, being unable to exercise, and struggling to fully engage in life, which can take a toll on your relationships with friends and family. I felt lazy and like I needed to push myself to do things. However, I quickly realized that letting myself rest when I needed to and showing myself compassion was much more important for my health. I took it easy until I started to feel better. Although I’m mostly back to my normal energy levels and don’t experience significant symptoms that often, I still have off days when I know I need to let myself rest, and that’s OK.What may help youI know what makes me feel worse — drinking alcohol, not getting enough sleep, and being overly stimulated or stressed. This is also true for many of my patients who have Hashimoto’s.And here’s what makes me and most of my patients feel better:spending time outside stretching and restorative activities like yogaeating lots of anti-inflammatory foods, especially veggiesfollowing a nutrient-dense diettaking hot Epsom salt bathsstaying hydratedavoiding caffeine and alcohol as much as possibleengaging in stress-reducing activities like gardening and hikinggetting plenty of sleeptaking certain supplements staying activeletting myself rest when I’m not feeling wellGenerally, following a nutritious, anti-inflammatory diet, reducing stress, and leading a healthy lifestyle are likely to reduce certain Hashimoto’s symptoms. However, it’s important to note that no specific diet is currently recommended to treat Hashimoto’s disease. Just because something works for one person doesn’t mean it works for others, which is one reason why self-experimentation is so important. It’s essential to get the right care  Share on PinterestCourtesy of Jillian KubalaI’m lucky that my endocrinologist is a wonderful doctor and personal friend with whom I feel comfortable asking questions and talking openly about my health. For many people, this isn’t the case.I’ve had patients who’ve been dismissed by numerous doctors, misdiagnosed, and not properly treated. Unfortunately, this is very common. In fact, up to one-third of people with hypothyroidism doesn’t receive adequate treatment.As mentioned above, it’s not uncommon for people to see multiple doctors before being diagnosed. Even after diagnosis, many people aren’t comfortable telling their doctor that their medication isn’t effective and that they’re still experiencing symptoms. It may take your doctor several attempts to get the dosing and medication right before you start feeling better. Make sure you choose a specialist with whom you feel comfortable discussing your symptoms and treatment options.You have the right to ask questions about your health, and your doctor should take your symptoms seriously. There are so many excellent doctors out there. If you’re uncomfortable with your provider, find another one. Some people find success by working only with an endocrinologist, others feel better after working with a dietitian to overhaul their diet and lifestyle, and still others prefer to see a functional medicine practitioner. Remember that you always have options. Use them.Moreover, try to work with a dietitian who specializes in hypothyroidism or autoimmune diseases if you decide to experiment with diet and supplements. These experts can help you determine the best regimen for your needs.Be your own advocateYou need to be your own health advocate. This is important for everyone with a medical condition to keep in mind. You know your body best. If you think there’s something wrong, keep digging. Don’t give up. Find a healthcare provider who’s thorough and listens to you. I know that going to numerous doctor’s appointments can be frustrating and time-consuming, as can trying various medications, dietary patterns, and supplements. Yet, I also know that these things are essential to improving your health and managing your symptoms. Lastly, remember that you’re not alone. Get help when you need it from friends, family, and healthcare providers. We’re all here to listen and support you on your path to feeling better.

Image Provided by Richard and Jill WendtAfter years of feeling unwell and overweight, Richard and Jill Wendt decided to embark on a weight loss journey together.The couple lost a combined 118 pounds by following the Mayo Clinic Diet.Today, they both feel physically and mentally healthier.In 2023, Jill and Richard Wendt decided to take charge of their weight and health. 51-year-old Richard had been taking blood pressure medication since his late 20s and used a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. And 49-year-old Jill reached a weight that made her feel uncomfortable and self-conscious.“Over the course of time, the weight just kept going up and up. It just kind of happens without you realizing it,” Jill told Healthline. “You just feel down and out about yourself, and you get in the cycle of, well, that sucks. I can’t find pants that fit, might as well go home and have something to eat because what’s the point? I can’t find clothes anyway?”Realizing that work stress and unhealthy eating habits had taken a toll on their health, the couple wanted to make a change.“[Knowing] what challenges our parents and grandparents had, if we can do anything to be proactive going into our older years, we wanted to be able to do that,” said Jill. “We might not be able to avoid some of those illnesses, but maybe they won’t be as bad for us.”They researched weight loss programs and decided to try the Mayo Clinic Diet in June 2023.Since then, Jill has lost 60 pounds, and Richard has lost 58 pounds. He no longer takes blood pressure medication or uses a CPAP machine.“I’m a stress eater, so [the diet] kind of brought that to my attention,” said Richard. “When I was in the office, it was easy having a stressful day to get up and walk to the snack machine and grab a bag of M&Ms or [when I’m] working from home, walk up the stairs and grab a bowl of cereal.”In addition to offering a food plan, he said the Mayo Clinic Diet helped him understand his unhealthy habits and how to practice healthier habits.What the Mayo Clinic Diet offersThe Mayo Clinic Diet is a digital weight loss program that uses a food groups system to create a whole-health menu program to follow.“It’s the perfect fit for all the patients who’ve walked into my office and said, ‘Can you please just tell me what to eat?’” Tara Schmidt, lead dietitian for the Mayo Clinic Diet, told Healthline.People can choose from seven different meal plans, including Simple, Healthy Keto, Mediterranean, and Protein Balance for GLP-1s.“We have numerous Diet members who are actively taking anti-obesity medications. With this in mind, we created a specific meal plan to address the unique needs of those on these medications, group coaching sessions around frequently asked questions, and continue to update content the more we learn from individuals and research,” said Schmidt.The program also provides education and behavior change and offers tools like recipes, virtual support, peer support, and a food tracker.The Wendts chose the Simple plan, which offers quick recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.“We did some freelancing with it and changed things or ingredients a little bit ourselves but generally tried to follow that,” said Richard. “It never felt like you were dieting, which is one of the things we really enjoyed about it. You were eating healthy, and nothing is off limits.”One stipulation for finding a program was not feeling deprived of foods they enjoy. For instance, following a program that removed dairy was out of the question.“[We] both grew up on a farm, and I love my milk. I’m not giving that up, so maybe I don’t drink as much, or if you like your sweets, you can still have them, but maybe you just don’t do it every night…or you find something that substitutes for that sweetness,” said Jill.Going back to the basics of healthy eating is something that Jill also gained from the program.“It’s re-learning what you learned as a kid with the food pyramid, the right portion sizes, it’s okay not to eat everything on your plate if you take too much, or if you’re at a restaurant, it’s okay to take the leftovers home,” she said.Christina Brown, MS, ACSM CPT, a nutrition and weight loss coach, said the majority of weight loss results are due to changing eating habits to ensure that people are not only eating quality calories but also eating in a calorie deficit.“In order to lose weight, you must eat fewer calories than you are burning,” she told Healthline. “The easiest way to ensure you are doing this is to track everything you are eating so you know exactly how many calories you take in. You cannot out-exercise a bad diet.”Breaking old habits and making healthier onesGuidance on habits to add and habits to break is another aspect of the diet that resonated with the couple.For instance, the habits they added included eating a healthy breakfast, as well as eating more vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and healthy fats.Some habits they learned to break included watching TV while eating, snacking (except for vegetables and fruit), and consuming sugar and alcohol.“I review the healthy habits every day before I go to sleep,” said Richard. “[Maybe] I didn’t have whole grains today…you’re not going to meet everything every day but just to keep that general trend of making sure you’re not straying off those healthy habits.”The couple incorporated the habit of exercising into their program, too, with Jill walking daily and Richard turning walking into running.“I was never much of a morning person, but now…I try to be out running by 5:30 most mornings. It just became something…I found out I really enjoyed,” he said.Losing weight together makes it easierResearch shows that people with partners who participate in lifestyle programs are more successful in reducing weight.“Unfortunately, we can very easily give up on ourselves, but if we have someone else counting on us, we are much less likely to give up,” said Brown.For example, she said if your partner is sticking to healthy meal planning, you will be more likely to or if you know they are meeting you at the gym for a workout, you will go even if you don’t want to because it is harder to cancel on them than on yourself.This notion motivated the Wendts to try the Mayo Clinic Diet together. If Jill signed up, she told Richard he also needed to.“I’m the one that usually prepares the meals, so to do it just for myself and then have to try to make something separate for him…would be difficult, but if we’re in it together, it’s easier,” she said.In addition to eating the same food, following habits together, like not eating in front of the TV, also helped them stick to it.Although the couple hit their goals, they plan to stay on the program for a while to maintain their weight and continue to use the program’s resources like its tracker and recipes.Schmidt said the program is a lifelong health approach and not a program that preaches a certain number of weeks of toughness.“We’re teaching our members to build new habits and slowly create eating and exercise practices they can continue long term,” she said. “A key predictor of weight loss maintenance is adherence. It’s important for people to find a method they can see themselves practicing for life.”The benefits the Wendts have experienced are their biggest motivator to carry on healthy habits after they stop the program.“We were putting up Christmas decorations yesterday and we were like wow a year or two years ago, going through the effort of hauling everything out we would be sweating and winded but this time…it wasn’t a struggle to get the boxes out,” said Jill.Feeling well together is the most rewarding part of their journey, she added.“Doing it together has been a fun thing to do…it just brings you closer cause you’re in it together,” said Jill.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Cathy Cassata on January 6, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextCan TikTok’s Viral 12-3-30 Treadmill Workout Really Help You Lose Weight?

Unlike supervised learning, where the data is labeled with a specific category or outcome, unsupervised learning algorithms are tasked with finding patterns and relationships within the data without any prior knowledge of the data's meaning. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms find hidden patterns and data without any human intervention, i.e., we don't give output to our model. The training model has only input parameter values and discovers the groups or patterns on its own. Unsupervised Learning The image shows set of animals: elephants, camels, and cows that represents raw data that the unsupervised learning algorithm will process. The \"Interpretation\" stage signifies that the algorithm doesn't have predefined labels or categories for the data. It needs to figure out how to group or organize the data based on inherent patterns.Algorithm represents the core of unsupervised learning process using techniques like clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection to identify patterns and structures in the data.Processing stage shows the algorithm working on the data.The output shows the results of the unsupervised learning process. In this case, the algorithm might have grouped the animals into clusters based on their species (elephants, camels, cows).How does unsupervised learning work?Unsupervised learning works by analyzing unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships. The data is not labeled with any predefined categories or outcomes, so the algorithm must find these patterns and relationships on its own. This can be a challenging task, but it can also be very rewarding, as it can reveal insights into the data that would not be apparent from a labeled dataset.Data-set in Figure A is Mall data that contains information about its clients that subscribe to them. Once subscribed they are provided a membership card and the mall has complete information about the customer and his/her every purchase. Now using this data and unsupervised learning techniques, the mall can easily group clients based on the parameters we are feeding in. The input to the unsupervised learning models is as follows: Unstructured data: May contain noisy(meaningless) data, missing values, or unknown dataUnlabeled data: Data only contains a value for input parameters, there is no targeted value(output). It is easy to collect as compared to the labeled one in the Supervised approach.Unsupervised Learning AlgorithmsThere are mainly 3 types of Algorithms which are used for Unsupervised dataset.ClusteringAssociation Rule LearningDimensionality Reduction 1. Clustering AlgorithmsClustering in unsupervised machine learning is the process of grouping unlabeled data into clusters based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge of the data's meaning. Broadly this technique is applied to group data based on different patterns, such as similarities or differences, our machine model finds. These algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups. For example, in the above figure, we have not given output parameter values, so this technique will be used to group clients based on the input parameters provided by our data.Some common clustering algorithms: K-means Clustering: Groups data into K clusters based on how close the points are to each other.Hierarchical Clustering: Creates clusters by building a tree step-by-step, either merging or splitting groups.Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN): Finds clusters in dense areas and treats scattered points as noise.Mean-Shift Clustering: Discovers clusters by moving points toward the most crowded areas.Spectral Clustering: Groups data by analyzing connections between points using graphs.2. Association Rule LearningAssociation rule learning is also known as association rule mining is a common technique used to discover associations in unsupervised machine learning. This technique is a rule-based ML technique that finds out some very useful relations between parameters of a large data set. This technique is basically used for market basket analysis that helps to better understand the relationship between different products.For e.g. shopping stores use algorithms based on this technique to find out the relationship between the sale of one product w.r.t to another's sales based on customer behavior. Like if a customer buys milk, then he may also buy bread, eggs, or butter. Once trained well, such models can be used to increase their sales by planning different offers.Some common Association Rule Learning algorithms: Apriori Algorithm: Finds patterns by exploring frequent item combinations step-by-step.FP-Growth Algorithm: An Efficient Alternative to Apriori. It quickly identifies frequent patterns without generating candidate sets.Eclat Algorithm: Uses intersections of itemsets to efficiently find frequent patterns.Efficient Tree-based Algorithms: Scales to handle large datasets by organizing data in tree structures.3. Dimensionality Reduction Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. This technique is useful for improving the performance of machine learning algorithms and for data visualization. Imagine a dataset of 100 features about students (height, weight, grades, etc.). To focus on key traits, you reduce it to just 2 features: height and grades, making it easier to visualize or analyze the data.Here are some popular Dimensionality Reduction algorithms:Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensions by transforming data into uncorrelated principal components.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA): Reduces dimensions while maximizing class separability for classification tasks.Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): Breaks data into non-negative parts to simplify representation.Locally Linear Embedding (LLE): Reduces dimensions while preserving the relationships between nearby points.Isomap: Captures global data structure by preserving distances along a manifold.Challenges of Unsupervised LearningHere are the key challenges of unsupervised learning:Noisy Data: Outliers and noise can distort patterns and reduce the effectiveness of algorithms.Assumption Dependence: Algorithms often rely on assumptions (e.g., cluster shapes), which may not match the actual data structure.Overfitting Risk: Overfitting can occur when models capture noise instead of meaningful patterns in the data.Limited Guidance: The absence of labels restricts the ability to guide the algorithm toward specific outcomes.Cluster Interpretability: Results, such as clusters, may lack clear meaning or alignment with real-world categories.Sensitivity to Parameters: Many algorithms require careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters in k-means.Lack of Ground Truth: Unsupervised learning lacks labeled data, making it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of results.Applications of Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning has diverse applications across industries and domains. Key applications include:Customer Segmentation: Algorithms cluster customers based on purchasing behavior or demographics, enabling targeted marketing strategies.Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns in data, aiding fraud detection, cybersecurity, and equipment failure prevention.Recommendation Systems: Suggests products, movies, or music by analyzing user behavior and preferences.Image and Text Clustering: Groups similar images or documents for tasks like organization, classification, or content recommendation.Social Network Analysis: Detects communities or trends in user interactions on social media platforms.Astronomy and Climate Science: Classifies galaxies or groups weather patterns to support scientific research\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nK means Clustering – Introduction\nM\nmohit gupta_omg :)\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learning\nSimilar Reads\nMachine Learning Tutorial  Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Steve Christo – Corbis/Getty ImagesResearchers report that people taking GLP-1 drugs in daily life don’t lose as much weight as those in clinical trials who take the same medications.The researchers add that people using weight loss drugs don’t regain weight as quickly as those in clinical trials.One possible reason for the weight loss differential is that people in the “real world” tend to stop taking these medications sooner than people in clinical trials.People who use commonly prescribed weight loss medications don’t lose as much weight as participants in clinical trials, but they also don’t regain weight as quickly.That’s the conclusion of a new study published on June 10 in the journal Obesity.The study authors reported that the weight loss differential was mainly due to the fact that people tend to stop using GLP-1 drugs sooner than clinical trial participants. They also tend to use lower doses of these medications.The researchers also reported that A1C blood level reductions were similar for both groups of people.The researchers noted that they will initiate further research into what other measures, such as lifestyle changes or bariatric surgery, people may have adopted after discontinuing weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound.The researchers also want to look into why people stopped using weight loss drugs before their program regimen ended.“Our findings indicate that treatment discontinuation and use of lower maintenance dosages might reduce the likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful weight reduction in patients who initiate obesity pharmacotherapy with semaglutide or tirzepatide,” the study authors wrote.“Our findings could inform the decisions of healthcare providers and their patients on the role of treatment discontinuation and maintenance dosage in achieving clinically meaningful weight loss,” they added.‘Real world’ use of weight loss medicationsFor their study, researchers looked at the health records of 7,881 adults with obesity or weight management issues who did not have type 2 diabetes.Those people were seen between 2021 and 2023 at the Cleveland Clinic’s facilities in Ohio and Florida. Their average age was about 51 years. Nearly 80% of the subjects were white.Of those participants, 6,109 were prescribed a weight loss medication such as Wegovy with the active ingredient semaglutide. The other 1,772 were prescribed a weight loss drug, such as Zepbound, with the active ingredient tirzepatide.About 80% of those subjects were given low doses of their weekly injectable weight loss medications.Researchers reported significant differences between people using weight loss medications in phase 3 clinical trials and those taking the drugs in the “real world.”For starters, about half of those taking either medication in daily life stopped within the first 12 months. About 51% of those using a tirzepatide drug discontinued its use in that same time period.That compares with only 17% of semaglutide users and between 14% and 16% of tirzepatide users in clinical trials who quit during the first year.In addition, the average weight reduction for semaglutide participants in daily life was nearly 8% after one year while it was 12% for people taking tirzepatide.By comparison, the average weight loss in clinical trials was nearly 15% for semaglutide subjects as well as 15% for people on low dose tirzepatide and 20% for those on a higher dose of that medication.In general, weight loss was greater in people who took weight loss medications for a longer period of time.In addition, about 54% of people who had prediabetes at the start of their treatment plan improved to healthier A1C levels after one year. Around 3% of those studied progressed to type 2 diabetes after 12 months.Weight loss is a long-term commitmentMir Ali, MD, a surgeon and bariatric surgeon as well as the medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California, said the main takeaway from this study is that weight loss is a long-term commitment. Ali wasn’t involved in the new study.“The long-term use of medications is more effective than short-term use,” Ali told Healthline. “The study confirms that obesity is a chronic condition like diabetes or hypertension.”Sarah Kim, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, noted that discontinuing medication is common for people being treated for obesity and other conditions. Kim was likewise not involved in the new study.Kim added that adherence to medication schedules as well as diet and exercise programs isn’t as easy in real life because people don’t have the supervision and support a person gets during a clinical trial.“Real life is different and results aren’t always as spectacular as in clinical trials,” Kim told Healthline.Kim and Ali agreed that another reason people stop taking medications is that these drugs can be expensive, even if insurance is picking up part of the cost.There is also the fact that the side effects from these medications can be severe for some people. Plus, people in real life sometimes just get tired of the obligation of taking a pill or injecting themselves on a regular basis.Ali and Kim also noted that people need to realize that medications are only a tool to help them eat less. To lose weight and keep it off, a person needs to adopt lifestyle habits such as a healthy diet and regular exercise.“The medications are not a short-term kickstart. They don’t burn fat,” said Kim. “The medications just help with the suppression of hunger.”“The ultimate goal of the medications is to give people a tool to get them to a healthy weight,” Ali added.What to know about GLP-1 drug for weight lossGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) work by mimicking a hormone in the body that helps regulate blood sugar levels and reduces hunger pangs.One class of the newer GLP-1 medications uses the active ingredient semaglutide. They are sold under different brand names. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been approved to treat type 2 diabetes. Wegovy is approved for use in weight management. Semaglutide drugs are available as both oral tablets and injections.The other newer group uses the active ingredient tirzepatide. Mounjaro is approved to treat type 2 diabetes. Zepbound is approved for use in weight management. These medications are available only as injections.Previous studies have highlighted the effectiveness of these drugs on helping people lose weight.Past research has also indicated that these weight loss drugs can help lower a person’s risk of cancer as well as provide benefits to heart health and brain health.Experts say the medications have proven to be effective and their use is likely to increase.“This is a massive market and it’s not going to go away,” Ali said. “These medications are going to continue to be a big part of weight loss programs.”Learn more about how to get GLP-1 medications from vetted and trusted online sources here:Where to Buy Ozempic OnlineWhere to Buy Ozempic OnlineHow to Get Mounjaro (Tirzepatide)Where to Buy Mounjaro (Tirzepatide) OnlineHow to Get Wegovy for Weight Loss In Person and OnlineHow to Get a Wegovy Prescription OnlineHow to Get Zepbound: What We Know So FarWhere to Buy Zepbound OnlineHow we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by David Mills on June 20, 2025 — Fact checked by Jill Seladi-Schulman, Ph.D.Read this nextZepbound More Effective for Weight Loss Than Wegovy, Eli Lilly Trial ShowsTirzepatide (Zepbound) led to more weight loss than semaglutide (Wegovy) in a clinical trial funded by Eli Lilly.

Unlike traditional clustering methods like K-Means, it doesn’t require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. Instead, it identifies the optimal number of clusters automatically based on the data. In this article, we’ll see the mathematical implementation of Affinity Propagation and its core concepts.Key Parameters Influencing ClusteringTo understand the math behind Affinity Propagation, we need to understand the two key parameters that influence the clustering process:1. PreferenceIt controls the number of exemplars (cluster centers) chosen by the algorithm.Higher preferences lead to more exemplars resulting in more clusters.2. Damping FactorThe damping factor helps stabilize the algorithm by limiting how much each update can change between iterations.Without damping, the algorithm can oscillate or keep bouncing between values helps in making it difficult to converge to a final solution.These two parameters play an important role in finding the stability and effectiveness of the algorithm as it iterates through its processes.Mathematical FormulationThe core idea behind Affinity Propagation is based on two matrices: responsibility and availability. The algorithm iteratively updates these matrices to find the best exemplars (centroids) representing the data.Similarity Matrix (Starting Point)We start with a similarity matrix S where S(i, j) represents the similarity between two points x_i​ and x_j​. The similarity is calculated as the negative squared Euclidean distance:S(i, j) = -\\lVert x_i - x_j \\rVert^2The diagonal elements of this matrix, S(i, i), represent the preference for each point to become an exemplar.Responsibility The responsibility matrix R is updated to reflect how well-suited point x_k​ is to serve as the exemplar for point x_i​, relative to other candidate exemplars:This is calculated as:r(i, k) \\leftarrow s(i, k) - \\max \\left\\{ a(i, k') + s(i, k') \\right\\}_{k' \\neq k}\nHere r(i,k) represents the responsibility of point x_k​ for being the exemplar of point x_i​ considering all other points k'.Availability The availability matrix A is updated to represent how appropriate it would be for point x_i​ to choose point x_k​ as its exemplar, considering the preferences of other points. This is calculated as:a(i, k) \\leftarrow \\min \\left( 0, r(k, k) + \\sum_{i' \\neq k} \\max \\left( 0, r(i', k) \\right) \\right) \\quad \\text{for} \\, i \\neq k \\,Where i is not eaul to k, and:a(k, k) \\leftarrow \\sum_{i' \\neq k} \\max \\left( 0, r(i', k) \\right)ConvergenceThese responsibility and availability matrices are updated iteratively until convergence at which point the algorithm selects the exemplars. The final step is to identify the points where the sum of responsibility and availability is positive:r(i, i) + a(i, i) > 0 Points that meet this condition are considered the exemplars and clusters are formed based on these exemplars.Visualizing the ProcessIn Affinity Propagation, messages are passed between data points in two main steps:Responsibility Messages (Left Side): These messages shows how each data point communicates with its candidate exemplars. Each point sends responsibility messages to suggest how suitable it is to be chosen as an exemplar.Availability Messages (Right Side): These messages reflect how appropriate it is for each data point to choose its corresponding exemplar considering the support from other points. Essentially, these messages show how much support the candidate exemplars have.The diagram above shows how the responsibility messages are passed on the left and the availability messages are passed on the right. This iterative message-passing process helps find the final exemplars for clustering.Python Implementation with Scikit-LearnHere we will be generating synthetic dataset for its implementation.Also we are using Sckit-Learn, Matplotlib and other libraries.AffinityPropagation(preference = -50): Initializes the algorithm with a preference value of -50 which influences the number of exemplars (cluster centers) generated by the algorithm.n_clusters_: Number of clusters is calculated by counting the exemplars identified by the algorithm.cluster_centers_indices_: Retrieves the indices of the data points that serve as cluster centers (exemplars).\nPython\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom itertools import cycle\ncenters = [[1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, -1], [-1, -1]]\nX, labels_true = make_blobs(n_samples = 400, centers = centers,\ncluster_std = 0.5, random_state = 0)\naf = AffinityPropagation(preference =-50).fit(X)\ncluster_centers_indices = af.cluster_centers_indices_\nlabels = af.labels_\nn_clusters_ = len(cluster_centers_indices)\nplt.close('all')\nplt.figure(1)\nplt.clf()\ncolors = cycle('bgrcmykbgrcmykbgrcmykbgrcmyk')\nfor k, col in zip(range(n_clusters_), colors):\nclass_members = labels == k\ncluster_center = X[cluster_centers_indices[k]]\nplt.plot(X[class_members, 0], X[class_members, 1], col + '.')\nplt.plot(cluster_center[0], cluster_center[1], 'o',\nmarkerfacecolor = col, markeredgecolor ='k',\nmarkersize = 14)\nfor x in X[class_members]:\nplt.plot([cluster_center[0], x[0]],\n[cluster_center[1], x[1]], col)\nplt.title('Estimated number of clusters: % d' % n_clusters_)\nplt.show()\nOutput:Clustering and visualization.The algorithm automatically detects 3 clusters without needing to pre-define the number of clusters.Advantages of Affinity PropagationNo need to pre-define clusters: The algorithm automatically finds the number of clusters based on the data.Handles varying cluster sizes and shapes: Unlike K-Means, it can identify clusters of different sizes and densities.Exemplars as cluster centers: Data points themselves serve as exemplars (cluster centers) helps in making the results more interpretable.Suitable for complex datasets: Performs well on datasets where traditional clustering methods like K-Means might struggle.Limitations of Affinity PropagationComputationally expensive: The algorithm can be slow for large datasets due to iterative updates of matrices.Sensitive to parameters: The preference and damping factor values significantly impact the results and may require tuning.Memory usage: The need to store and update large similarity matrices can be memory-intensive.Convergence issues: The algorithm may not converge properly if the damping factor is not tuned correctly.By mastering Affinity Propagation, one can effectively identify clusters in complex datasets without the need to predefine the number of clusters while also gaining insights into parameter tuning and computational considerations for optimal performance.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nTop 15 Machine Learning Algorithms Every Data Scientist Should Know in 2025\nD\nDebomit Dey\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nMachine Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nML-Clustering\nAI-ML-DS With Python\nPractice Tags :\nMachine Learning\nSimilar Reads\nMachine Learning Algorithms  Machine learning algorithms are essentially sets of instructions that allow computers to learn from data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

In a note dated Thursday, the firm upgraded the chip stock to buy from hold and hiked its price target to $245 from $200, which implies more than 11% upside. \"With more confidence the industrial semis de-stocking is ending, and flexible CapEx in 2026+, we raise our estimates and upgrade shares of TI to Buy with a $245 PT,\" analyst Joshua Buchalter wrote. \"Tariff/ macro concerns linger, but we see TI positioned to outperform in either a sharp or gradual recovery.\" Texas Instruments has surged nearly 49% over the past three months, outpacing both the S & P 500 and artificial intelligence chip darling Nvidia during that timeframe. Shares have also more than doubled the broader market's gains in 2025, rising more than 17% year to date compared to the S & P 500's almost 7% jump. TXN NVDA 3M mountain TXN vs. NVDA, 3-month Though Buchalter noted that President Donald Trump's tariffs linger , which could lead to some demand constraints, he thinks \"inventory dynamics are the bigger swing factor for broad-based semis this earnings season.\" \"Given TI's limited use of the channel, we believe the company is at the front of the line to participate in a recovery as consumption more closely matches sell-through, and for any potential end demand recovery,\" he wrote. \"As supply and demand more closely align, we believe TI's cost-accretive US-based 300mm manufacturing footprint, and realigned embedded portfolio, position the company to regain share in key industrial and automotive end markets.\" Beyond that, Buchalter said the company will generate significant free-cash-flow growth, seeing it more than double in share price by 2026. He also estimates that its capital expenditures will reach $2.5 billion next year. Buchalter's bullish call is in the minority on Wall Street, however. Out of the 39 analysts covering Texas Instruments, only 12 have a strong buy or buy rating, according to LSEG, while 23 have stepped to the sidelines with a hold rating. The stock was almost 1% higher in the premarket on Friday following the upgrade.More In Analyst CallsThis Chinese robotaxi stock can more than double as production ramps up, analysts say Brian EvansHere are Monday's biggest analyst calls: Nvidia, Tesla, Rivian, Best Buy, Taiwan Semiconductor, Coinbase and moreMichael BloomEvercore ISI downgrades Procter & Gamble as it loses market share on AmazonLisa Kailai HanRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

In this article we will be apply RNNs to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews from Swiggy food delivery platform. The goal is to classify reviews as positive or negative for providing insights into customer experiences.We will conduct a Sentiment Analysis using the TensorFlow framework: 1. Importing Libraries and DatasetHere we will be importing numpy, pandas, Regular Expression (RegEx), scikit learn and tenserflow.\nPython\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense, Embedding\n2. Loading DatasetWe will be using swiggy dataset of customer reviews. You can download dataset from here. pd.read_csv() : Reads the CSV file into a Pandas DataFramedata.columns : Accesses the column names of the DataFrametolist() : Converts the column names from an Index object to a regular Python list\nPython\ndata = pd.read_csv('swiggy.csv')\nprint(\"Columns in the dataset:\")\nprint(data.columns.tolist())\nOutput:Columns in the dataset: ['ID', 'Area', 'City', 'Restaurant Price', 'Avg Rating', 'Total Rating', 'Food Item', 'Food Type', 'Delivery Time', 'Review']3. Text Cleaning and Sentiment LabelingWe will clean the review text, create a sentiment label based on ratings and remove any missing values.data[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].str.lower() : Converts all text in the \"Review\" column to lowercasedata[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].replace(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', regex=True) : Removes all characters except letters, numbers and spaces from the \"Review\" columndata['sentiment'] = data['Avg Rating'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 3.5 else 0) : Creates a new \"sentiment\" column with 1 for ratings above 3.5 and 0 otherwisedata = data.dropna() : Removes rows that contain any missing values\nPython\ndata[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].str.lower()\ndata[\"Review\"] = data[\"Review\"].replace(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', regex=True)\ndata['sentiment'] = data['Avg Rating'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 3.5 else 0)\ndata = data.dropna()\n4. Tokenization and PaddingWe will prepare the text data by tokenizing and padding it and extract the target sentiment labels. Tokenizer converts words into integer sequences and padding ensures all input sequences have the same length (max_length).max_features = 5000 : Sets the maximum number of words to keep in the tokenizermax_length = 200 : Defines the fixed length for each input sequence after paddingTokenizer(num_words=max_features) : Initializes the tokenizer to keep the top 5000 words onlytokenizer.fit_on_texts(data[\"Review\"]) : Builds the word index based on the reviews in the datasettokenizer.texts_to_sequences(data[\"Review\"]) : Converts each review into a sequence of word indexespad_sequences(..., maxlen=max_length) : Pads or truncates each sequence to the same length (200)y = data['sentiment'].values : Extracts the sentiment labels as a NumPy array for model training\nPython\nmax_features = 5000\nmax_length = 200\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=max_features)\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts(data[\"Review\"])\nX = pad_sequences(tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(data[\"Review\"]), maxlen=max_length)\ny = data['sentiment'].values\nNote: These concepts are a not a part of RNN but are done to make model prediction better. You can refer to tokenization and padding for more details.5. Splitting the DataWe will split the data into training, validation and test sets while maintaining the class distribution.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y) : Splits data into 80% training and 20% test sets, preserving sentiment class balancetrain_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.1, random_state=42, stratify=y_train) : Further splits training data into 90% training and 10% validation sets, keeping class distribution consistent\nPython\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\nX, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y\n)\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(\nX_train, y_train, test_size=0.1, random_state=42, stratify=y_train\n)\n6. Building RNN ModelWe will build and compile a simple RNN model for binary sentiment classification.Sequential([...]) : Creates a sequential neural network modelEmbedding(input_dim=max_features, output_dim=16, input_length=max_length) : Maps input words to 16-dimensional vectorsSimpleRNN(64, activation='tanh', return_sequences=False) : Adds a recurrent layer with 64 units using tanh activationDense(1, activation='sigmoid') : Adds an output layer with one neuron using sigmoid activation for binary outputmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) : Configures the model with binary crossentropy loss, Adam optimizer and accuracy metric\nPython\nmodel = Sequential([\nEmbedding(input_dim=max_features, output_dim=16, input_length=max_length),\nSimpleRNN(64, activation='tanh', return_sequences=False),\nDense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n])\nmodel.compile(\nloss='binary_crossentropy',\noptimizer='adam',\nmetrics=['accuracy']\n)\n7. Training and Evaluating ModelWe will train the model on training data, validate it during training, then evaluate its performance on test data.model.fit(...) : Trains the model for 5 epochs with batch size 32, validating on the validation setmodel.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0) : Evaluates the trained model on test data without extra outputprint(f\"Test accuracy: {score[1]:.2f}\") : Prints the test accuracy rounded to two decimal places\nPython\nhistory = model.fit(\nX_train, y_train,\nepochs=5,\nbatch_size=32,\nvalidation_data=(X_val, y_val),\nverbose=1\n)\nscore = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)\nprint(f\"Test accuracy: {score[1]:.2f}\")\nOutput: Training and Evaluating ModelOur model achieved a accuracy of 72% which is great for a RNN model. We can further fine tune it to achieve more accuracy. 8. Predicting SentimentWe will create a function to preprocess a single review, predict its sentiment and display the result.review_text.lower() : Converts the input review text to lowercasere.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', text) : Removes all characters except letters, numbers and spacestokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text]) : Converts the cleaned review into a sequence of word indexespad_sequences(seq, maxlen=max_length) : Pads the sequence to the fixed lengthmodel.predict(padded)[0][0] : Predicts the sentiment probability for the reviewReturns \"Positive\" if prediction is 0.5 or above, otherwise \"Negative\", including the probability score\nPython\ndef predict_sentiment(review_text):\ntext = review_text.lower()\ntext = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', text)\nseq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])\npadded = pad_sequences(seq, maxlen=max_length)\nprediction = model.predict(padded)[0][0]\nreturn f\"{'Positive' if prediction >= 0.5 else 'Negative'} (Probability: {prediction:.2f})\"\nsample_review = \"The food was great.\"\nprint(f\"Review: {sample_review}\")\nprint(f\"Sentiment: {predict_sentiment(sample_review)}\")\nOutput: Predicting SentimentIn summary the model processes textual reviews through RNN to predict sentiment from raw data. This helps in actionable insights by understanding customer sentiment.You can download the source code from here.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nText Generation using Recurrent Long Short Term Memory Network\nM\nmazumdarabhishek94\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nPython\nNeural Network\nPractice Tags :\npython\nSimilar Reads\nDeep Learning Tutorial  Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to learn from large datasets using multi-layered neural networks.

They consist of layers of neurons that transform the input data into meaningful outputs through a series of mathematical operations. In this article, we are going to explore different types of neural networks. Neural Network basic framework1. Feedforward Neural NetworksFeedforward neural networks are a form of artificial neural network where without forming any cycles between layers or nodes means inputs can pass data through those nodes within the hidden level to the output nodes.Architecture: Made up of layers with unidirectional flow of data i.e from input through hidden and the output layer.Training: Backpropagation is often used during training for the main aim of reducing the prediction errors.Applications: In visual and voice recognition, NLP, financial forecasting and recommending systemWhen to use: Best for general-purpose tasks like classification and regression. Ideal when data is static and has no sequential dependencies.2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)Convolutional neural networks structure is focused on processing the grid type data like images and videos by using convolutional layers filtering driving the patterns and spatial hierarchies.Key Components: Utilizing convolutional layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers.Applications: Used for classification of images, object detection, medical imaging analyzes, autonomous driving and visualization in augmented reality.When to use: Use when working with image, video or grid-structured data.3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)Recurrent neural network handles sequential data in which the current output is a result of previous inputs by looping over themselves to hold internal state (memory).Architecture: Contains recurrent connections that enable feedback loops for processing sequences.Challenges: Problems such as vanishing gradients become apparent since they limit capturing interdependence on a long scale.Applications: Language translation, open-ended text classification, ones to ones interaction and time series prediction are its applications.When to use: Use for tasks involving sequences like text, speech or time series.4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) are a variant of RNNs. They exhibit memory cells to solve the disappearing gradient issue and keep large ranges of information in their memory.Key Features: Capture memory cells in pass information flowing and graduate greediness issue.Applications: Value of RNNs is in terms of importing long-term memory into the model like language translation and time-series forecasting.When to use: Use when you need to model long-term dependencies in sequences.5. Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) is the second usual variant of RNNs which is working on gating mechanism just like LSTM but with little parameter.Advantages: Vanishing gradient issue is addressed and it is compute-efficient than LSTM.Applications: LSTM is also involved in tasks that can be categorized as similar to speech recognition and text monitoring.When to use: Use when LSTM-like performance is needed but with lower computational cost.Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)6. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs)Radial basis function (RBF) networks can be regarded as models which define radial basis functions that are very useful in the function approximation and classification approaches and is used in complex input-output data modelling.Applications: It includes regression, pattern recognition and system control methods for fast-tracking.When to use: Good choice for function approximation and small to medium-scale classification tasks.7. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)Self-Organizing Maps are unsupervised neural networks, these networks are used for unsupervised cluster generation based on the retaining of topological features of the high dimensional data from an upper dimensional source, transformed into low dimensional form of output data.Features: Design methods that reduces the dimension of data from the high dimension into a low dimension without loss of the underlying geometry of the data.Applications: Visualizing data, discovering customers segments, locating anomalies and selecting needed features.When to use: Ideal for data visualization, clustering and dimensionality reduction.8. Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)The architecture of the Deep Belief Networks is built on many stochastic, latent variables that are used for both deep supervised and unsupervised tasks such as nonlinear feature learning and mid dimensional representation.Function: If you are looking for the most effective architecture of data that can be learned via classification, this algorithm is very useful.Applications: Image and voice recognition, natural language understanding and smart devices as recommendations systems.When to use: Use when you're interested in unsupervised pre-training or deep feature extraction.9. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)Generative Adversarial Networks has made up of of two neural networks, the generator and discriminator which compete against each other. The generator creates a fake generated data and the discriminator learns to differentiate the real from and fake data.Working Principle: Generator evolves after each iteration while the fake data being generated. This simultaneously makes the discriminator more discriminating as it determines whether the components are real or generated.Applications: They have proved useful not only for pattern generation but also data augmentation, style transfer and learning without any supervision.When to use: Use when you need to generate realistic synthetic data.10. Autoencoders (AE)Autoencoders are feedforward networks (ANNs) that are trained to acquire the most helpful presentations of the information through the process of re-coding the input data. The encoder is pinpointed to precisely map the input into the legal latent space representation while the decoder does the opposite, decoding the space from this representation.Functionality: Help in techniques like dimensionality reduction, information extraction, noise removal and generative modelling the images become comprehensible.Types: Variants include undercomplete, overcomplete and variational autoencoders.When to use: Use for unsupervised learning tasks like data compression, noise removal and anomaly detection.11. Siamese Neural NetworksSiamese Neural Network work with networks of the same structure and an identical architecture. Comparison is being made via a similarity metric that can tell the degree of resemblance the two networks have.Applications: Face recognition as the signature, retrieval of information, image similarity comparison and category tasks.When to use: Ideal when comparing two inputs to determine similarity like face verification.12. Capsule Networks (CapsNet)The layers of Capsule Networks do not only incorporate localization relations of data but allows multilevel structure by passing the information from lower convolutional layers to higher. They use cyclicals to the items and their bodies too, of course, they do not do that at the same time.Applications: Image classification, object detection and scene understanding via the immense visual data exposure.When to use: Use for image classification where part-to-whole relationships matter.13. Transformer NetworksTransformer Networks do this by way of self-attention mechanism which results into a parallel process used for making the tokenization inputs faster and thus improved capturing of long range dependencies.Key Features: Provides better performance than any of the other models due to their capability to process natural language sufficiently and handle tasks related to machine translation, generating text and document summarization.Applications: The application of this technology had got more popular, specially in language understanding tasks and image and audio data processing applications of this time and more similar tasks.When to use: Use for NLP tasks like translation, text generation and summarization.14. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)Main thing related with Spiking Neural Networks is the brain functionality which is processed by action potentials (spikes) in biological neurons in the same way. These are the key factors of \"neuromorphic\" technology which perform the deep learning and avoid another type of processing as well.Applications: Neuromorphic processes, learning and computation in spiro-neural computing, cognitive processes modeling and mind-related computing are also carried out with this.When to use: Use when working on neuromorphic computing and biologically inspired architectures.Applications of Neural NetworksThe uses of neural networks are diverse and cut across many distinct industries and domains. Some of its applications are:Healthcare: Neural networks play a critical role in medical image analysis, disease diagnosis, personalized treatment plans, drug discovery and healthcare management systems.Finance: They have a very strong influence on algorithmic trading, fraud detection, credit scoring, risk management and portfolio optimization.Entertainment: They allow development of recommendation systems for movies, music, books and character animation as well as virtual reality experiences.Manufacturing: They innovate in supply chain management especially in optimizing it, predictive maintenance, quality control processes and industrial automation.Transportation: The human brain is incorporated into the auto-piloted cars for the purpose of perception, making decisions and navigation.Environmental Sciences: They help construct climate models, satellite monitoring and ecological observation.\nTypes of Neural Networks\nVisit Course\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nLayers in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\nK\nkolisuszprv\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nBlogathon\nDeep Learning\nAI-ML-DS\nNeural Network\nData Science Blogathon 2024\n+1 More\nSimilar Reads\nDeep Learning Tutorial  Deep Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to learn from large datasets using multi-layered neural networks.

Here's how the pros are investingPublished Mon, Jul 14 202510:32 PM EDTUpdated 4 Hours AgoAmala Balakrishner@in/amala-balakrishner@_amalabkWATCH LIVEU.S. President Donald Trump's fresh 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico have sent gold prices higher. The previous metal topped a three-week high on Monday , as investors piled into gold, which is usually considered a safe haven asset in times of turbulence. As of 10:20 p.m. ET Monday, spot gold was up 0.21% at $3,350.69 per ounce. Mounting geopolitical tensions and uncertainties from Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs have sent gold prices up by around 28% since the start of the year. By comparison, the broad-based S & P 500 index has risen 6.58% in the same time, while yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury have moved down 13.4 basis points. \"Gold has outperformed the S & P 500 and even other traditional safe haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries, which haven't necessarily provided that stability because of their volatility and fluctuating yields,\" Alonso Munoz, chief investment officer and founding partner at the U.S.-headquartered Hamilton Capital Partners, said. XAU= YTD mountain Mounting geopolitical tensions and uncertainties from Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs have sent gold prices up by around 28% since the start of the year Speaking to CNBC Pro, Munoz noted a pick-up in investor interest in the precious metal \"after they've seen gold outperform and act as a hedge, at least certainly during the first and second quarter, where we had a lot of volatility in high-risk assets.\" The investor sees scope for gold to continue to push higher this year, \"as long as things remain uncertain.\" Chee Keong Koh, head of forex strategy at wealth management firm WRISE, said he expects spot gold to hover between $3,100 and $3,500 for the rest of 2025. \"Gold's performance during times of crises, its ability to act as a store of value and its role as an effective diversifier continue to be key reasons for why investors continue to allocate gold as part of risk management and tactical trading strategies, as global reserves increasingly shift away from heavy U.S. dollar reliance over the next five years ,\" Koh said, citing findings from a recent survey by the World Gold Council. The council — which represents the gold industry — found that 95% of survey respondents foresee an increase in global central banks' gold reserves in the next 12 months. Meanwhile, 73% predict significantly lower U.S. dollar holdings within reserves over the next five years. Aside from the de-dollarization push, Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist APAC at LGT Private Banking Asia, expects gold prices to rise further as the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to lower interest rates . He foresees gold hitting $3,650 per ounce in the next 12 months, a close to 9% rise from its current levels. \"Inflation expectations are going up. People are going to be buying gold against that,\" Hofer told CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Monday. Hofer dismissed \" outlandish \" calls of gold reaching $5,000 per ounce or more, but said a 10% rise over the next 12 months, \"means, that in a portfolio context, you could do rather well if you have maybe, say, 5% or so allocation.\" Gold stocks and ETFs WRISE's Koh recommends that investors who want to buy into gold consider entering closer to the $3,100-per-ounce range \"as part of a broader portfolio diversification strategy.\" Among his top gold stock picks are mining companies Barrick Gold and Newmont Corporation . Both companies present \"solid opportunities given their solid earnings growth and strategic positioning in the gold market,\" according to Koh. Beyond stocks, he also sees opportunities in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF and VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF . The former has returned nearly 55% since the start of the year, while the latter's returns are over 60%. Physical gold Holding on to physical gold, in the form of gold bars, is another way to invest, Hamilton Capital's Munoz pointed out. \"I've always thought that if investors own gold, for its safety and protection against catastrophe and significant drops in the market, they should own it physically versus just tracking the price of gold in a product where there's counterparty risk,\" he said. The investor observes that his clients, who are predominantly high-net-worth individuals and family offices, like that physical gold is a \"safe and tangible store of value that tracks the price of gold at a much lower cost.\" For instance, an ETF charges investors between 10-40 basis points each year just to own a derivative of gold. So an investor with a 5% allocation to gold by way of an ETF will make a cost saving by owning the physical metal, Munoz said. However, those considering buying physical gold should consider storage costs , he added. Safe haven? While gold is often touted as the classic safe-haven asset, Will McDonough, CEO of merchant bank Corestone Capital, believes it could be losing its edge. He said rival asset classes could include copper, as well as bitcoin, which crossed the $120,000 threshold to hit a record high on Monday . \"Gold has far less real-world use cases than copper. And bitcoin is taking a lot of energy away from gold — so the safe-haven allocation that used to go to gold is now facing competition from other assets,\" McDonough told CNBC Pro. Still, the investor sees value in gold by way of the physical asset and gold futures.More In Investing trendsComing to a 401(k) near you: Private market assetsSarah MinTrump’s copper tariff supercharges U.S. prices — but experts are divided if there is an investment opportunityAmala BalakrishnerSingapore state investor Temasek is rethinking defense as a strategic ESG betChloe TaylorRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

This technology has been developed over the years and has become increasingly sophisticated, with the ability to produce accurate translations across a wide range of languages. The article explores more about machine translation, why we need it and its applications.\nTable of Content\nWhat is Machine Translation?What are the key approaches in Machine Translation?Why we need Machine Translation in NLP?What is the application of Machine Translation?Can Human Translators be replaced by AI?What is Machine Translation?Machine translation is a sub-field of computational linguistics that focuses on developing systems capable of automatically translating text or speech from one language to another. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the goal of machine translation is to produce translations that are not only grammatically correct but also convey the meaning of the original content accurately.\nMachine Translation Model History of Machine Translation The automatic translation of text from one natural language (the source) to another is known as machine translation (the target). It was one of the first applications for computers that were imagined (Weaver, 1949).\nThere have been three primary uses of machine translation in the past:\nRough translation, such as that given by free internet services, conveys the \"gist\" of a foreign statement or document but is riddled with inaccuracies. Companies utilize pre-edited translation to publish documentation and sales materials in several languages.The original source content is written in a limited language that makes machine translation easier, and the outputs are often edited by a person to rectify any flaws.Restricted-source translation is totally automated, but only for highly stereotyped language like a weather report.What are the key approaches in Machine Translation?In machine translation, the original text is decoded and then encoded into the target language through two step process that involves various approaches employed by language translation technology to facilitate the translation mechanism.\n1. Rule-Based Machine Translation Rule-based machine translation relies on these resources to ensure precise translation of specific content. The process involves the software parsing input text, generating a transitional representation, and then converting it into the target language with reference to grammar rules and dictionaries.\n2. Statistical Machine Translation Rather than depending on linguistic rules, statistical machine translation utilizes machine learning for text translation. Machine learning algorithms examine extensive human translations, identifying statistical patterns. When tasked with translating a new source text, the software intelligently guesses based on the statistical likelihood of specific words or phrases being associated with others in the target language.\n3. Neural Machine Translation (NMT)A neural network, inspired by the human brain, is a network of interconnected nodes functioning as an information system. Input data passes through these nodes to produce an output. Neural machine translation software utilizes neural networks to process vast datasets, with each node contributing a specific change from source text to target text until the final result is obtained at the output node.\n4. Hybrid Machine Translation Hybrid machine translation tools integrate multiple machine translation models within a single software application, leveraging a combination of approaches to enhance the overall effectiveness of a singular translation model. This process typically involves the incorporation of rule-based and statistical machine translation subsystems, with the ultimate translation output being a synthesis of the results generated by each subsystem.\nWhy we need Machine Translation in NLP?Machine translation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has several benefits, including:\nImproved communication: Machine translation makes it easier for people who speak different languages to communicate with each other, breaking down language barriers and facilitating international cooperation.Cost savings: Machine translation is typically faster and less expensive than human translation, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses and organizations that need to translate large amounts of text.Increased accessibility: Machine translation can make digital content more accessible to users who speak different languages, improving the user experience and expanding the reach of digital products and services.Improved efficiency: Machine translation can streamline the translation process, allowing businesses and organizations to quickly translate large amounts of text and improving overall efficiency.Language learning: Machine translation can be a valuable tool for language learners, helping them to understand the meaning of unfamiliar words and phrases and improving their language skills.What is the application of Machine Translation?Machine translation has many applications, including:\nCross-border communication: Machine translation allows people from different countries to communicate with each other more easily, breaking down language barriers and facilitating international cooperation.Localization: Machine translation can be used to quickly and efficiently translate websites, software, and other digital content into different languages, making them more accessible to users around the world.Business: Machine translation can be used by businesses to translate documents, contracts, and other important materials, enabling them to work with partners and customers from around the world.Education: Machine translation can be used in education to help students learn new languages and improve their language skills.Government: Machine translation can be used by governments to translate official documents and communications, improving accessibility and transparency.Can Human Translators be replaced by AI?Challenges arise as different languages categorize and express concepts in diverse ways, demanding careful consideration in translation. The use of an interlingua, a representation language capturing distinctions among languages, becomes essential. Whether undertaken by humans or machines, effective translation involves grasping the entirety of the scenario presented in the source, not just individual words. Complexities further intensify when dealing with cultural and grammatical nuances, underscoring the intricacies of the translation endeavor.\nIt can be challenging for translators (both machine and human) to make this decision. \"The baseball struck the window,\" for example, maybe translated as \"The baseball hit the window.\" In order to translate \"it broke\" into French, we must pick between the feminine \"elle\" and the masculine \"il,\" indicating whether \"it\" refers to the baseball or the window. To get the translation properly, you'll need to know both physics and language.\nWhile AI and machine translation systems continue to improve, the goal should be seen as augmentation rather than replacement. Many applications benefit from a collaborative approach where AI tools assist human translators in their work, improving efficiency and consistency. The human touch remains crucial for nuanced, accurate, and culturally sensitive translations.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nRational Agent in AI\nM\nmohit gupta_omg :)\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nNLP\nArtificial Intelligence\nSimilar Reads\nReasoning Mechanisms in AI Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are designed to mimic human intelligence and decision-making processes, and reasoning is a critical component of these capabilities.

This article explains an approach using the averaging filter, while this article provides one using a median filter. However, these convolutions often result in a loss of important edge information, since they blur out everything, irrespective of it being noise or an edge. To counter this problem, the non-linear bilateral filter was introduced.\nGaussian Blur\nGaussian blurring can be formulated as follows:\nHere, GA[I]_p  is the result at pixel p, and the RHS is essentially a sum over all pixels q weighted by the Gaussian function. I_q  is the intensity at pixel q.\nBilateral Filter: an Additional Edge Term\nThe bilateral filter can be formulated as follows:\nHere, the normalization factor and the range weight are new terms added to the previous equation. \\sigma_s  denotes the spatial extent of the kernel, i.e. the size of the neighborhood, and \\sigma_r  denotes the minimum amplitude of an edge. It ensures that only those pixels with intensity values similar to that of the central pixel are considered for blurring, while sharp intensity changes are maintained. The smaller the value of \\sigma_r  , the sharper the edge. As \\sigma_r  tends to infinity, the equation tends to a Gaussian blur.OpenCV has a function called bilateralFilter() with the following arguments:\nd: Diameter of each pixel neighborhood.sigmaColor: Value of \\sigma  in the color space. The greater the value, the colors farther to each other will start to get mixed.sigmaSpace: Value of \\sigma  in the coordinate space. The greater its value, the more further pixels will mix together, given that their colors lie within the sigmaColor range.\nCode : Input : Noisy Image.\nCode : Implementing Bilateral Filtering\nPython\nimport cv2\n# Read the image.\nimg = cv2.imread('taj.jpg')\n# Apply bilateral filter with d = 15,\n# sigmaColor = sigmaSpace = 75.\nbilateral = cv2.bilateralFilter(img, 15, 75, 75)\n# Save the output.\ncv2.imwrite('taj_bilateral.jpg', bilateral)\nOutput of Bilateral Filter\nComparison with Average and Median filters Below is the output of the average filter (cv2.blur(img, (5, 5))).\nBelow is the output of the median filter (cv2.medianBlur(img, 5)).\nBelow is the output of the Gaussian filter (cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5, 5), 0)).\nIt is easy to note that all these denoising filters smudge the edges, while Bilateral Filtering retains them.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nImage Inpainting using OpenCV\nA\nAnannya Uberoi 1\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nPython\nImage-Processing\nOpenCV\nPython-OpenCV\nPractice Tags :\npython\nSimilar Reads\nOpenCV Tutorial in Python  OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library.

It involves detecting significant local changes in the intensity of an image, which typically correspond to the edges of objects. By highlighting these edges, edge detection simplifies the image, making it easier to analyze and understand.This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of edge detection techniques in image processing, highlighting their definitions, types, characteristics, and applications.Table of ContentBasics of EdgeImportance of Edge Detection in Computer Vision and Image ProcessingEdge Detection TechniquesTypes of Edge DetectionGradient-Based Methods1. Sobel Operator 2. Prewitt Operator3. Roberts Cross OperatorLaplacian-Based Methods1. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)2. Difference of Gaussian (DoG)Canny Edge DetectorConclusionEdge Detection - Frequently Asked QuestionsBasics of EdgeEdges can be defined as the points in an image where the intensity of pixels changes sharply. These changes often correspond to the physical boundaries of objects within the scene.Characteristics of Edges Gradient Magnitude: The edge strength is determined by the gradient magnitude, which measures the rate of change in intensity.Gradient Direction: The direction of the edge is perpendicular to the direction of the gradient, indicating the orientation of the boundary.Localization: Edges should be well-localized, meaning they should accurately correspond to the true boundaries in the image.Noise Sensitivity: Edges can be affected by noise, making it essential to use techniques that can distinguish between actual edges and noise.Types of EdgesEdges can be classified into several types based on their appearance and the way intensity changes occur:1. Step EdgesDefinition: A step edge is characterized by a sudden and significant change in intensity between two adjacent regions.Characteristics: These are the most common type of edges, representing clear boundaries between objects. In an ideal step edge, the transition is abrupt, though in real images, it might be affected by factors such as blurring and noise.2. Line EdgesDefinition: A line edge occurs where there is a transition in intensity that results in a thin line, typically surrounded by areas of different intensity.Characteristics: Line edges can be thought of as narrow regions where the intensity changes sharply but returns to its original value after a small distance. These edges are common in patterns and textures.3. Junction EdgesDefinition: Junction edges occur at the intersection of two or more edges, where multiple intensity transitions meet.Characteristics: These are complex edge points where different boundaries converge, forming T-junctions, Y-junctions, or other complex shapes. Junction edges are crucial for interpreting the structure and relationships between different objects in an image.Importance of Edge Detection in Computer Vision and Image ProcessingEdge detection plays a crucial role in various applications within computer vision and image processing:Object Recognition: By identifying the outlines of objects, edge detection helps in recognizing and classifying different objects within an image.Image Segmentation: It aids in dividing an image into meaningful regions, facilitating tasks such as object tracking and scene understanding.Feature Extraction: Edges provide essential features for further analysis, contributing to better accuracy in tasks like face recognition and medical imaging.Image Compression: By detecting and preserving edges, images can be compressed more efficiently without significant loss of important details.Edge Detection TechniquesEdge detection is a process used in image processing and computer vision to identify significant changes in brightness or color that typically correspond to the boundaries of objects within an image. This process simplifies the image, making it easier to analyze and interpret the shapes and structures present.The primary goal of edge detection is to capture the essential structural information in an image while reducing the amount of data to be processed. By focusing on the edges, the algorithms can highlight important features such as object outlines, textures, and patterns.Types of Edge DetectionEdge detection techniques can be broadly categorized based on the method they use to identify edges. Here are the main types:Gradient-Based MethodsSobel OperatorRoberts Cross OperatorPrewitt OperatorSecond-Order Derivative MethodsLaplacian of Gaussian (LoG)Difference of Gaussians (DoG)Optimal Edge DetectionCanny Edge DetectorMulti-Scale Edge DetectionWavelet TransformMachine Learning and Deep Learning-Based MethodsStructured ForestsConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)Gradient-Based Methods1. Sobel Operator The Sobel operator is a discrete differentiation operator that computes an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. It uses convolutional masks to highlight regions with high spatial frequency, which correspond to edges.The Sobel operator uses two 3x3 convolution masks, one for detecting changes in the horizontal direction (Gx) and one for the vertical direction (Gy).\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-2 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is then computed as:G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}}AdvantagesSimple and easy to implement.Provides good edge detection in images with noise due to the smoothing effect.DisadvantagesThe Sobel operator can be sensitive to noise.It may not perform well on edges that are not aligned with the grid of the masks.2. Prewitt OperatorThe Prewitt operator is similar to the Sobel operator but uses a different convolution mask. It also approximates the gradient of the image intensity function, focusing on edge detection.The Prewitt operator uses the following 3x3 convolution masks for horizontal (Gx) and vertical (Gy) edge detection:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is computed similarly:G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}}AdvantagesEasy to implement and computationally efficient.Performs well for detecting horizontal and vertical edges.DisadvantagesLike the Sobel operator, it can be sensitive to noise.May not be effective for detecting edges at angles other than 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°.3. Roberts Cross OperatorThe Roberts Cross operator is an early edge detection method that computes the gradient at a point in the image using the differences between diagonally adjacent pixels. It emphasizes edge detection along the diagonals.The Roberts Cross operator uses two 2x2 convolution masks for diagonal edge detection:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0  \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is then computed as:G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}}AdvantagesVery simple and easy to implement.Provides a high response to edges at 45° angles.DisadvantagesExtremely sensitive to noise due to the small size of the masks.Does not perform well on smooth or less noisy images.Limited accuracy for detecting edges not aligned with the masks.Laplacian-Based Methods1. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is a method used to detect edges in an image. It involves smoothing the image with a Gaussian filter to reduce noise, followed by applying the Laplacian operator to highlight regions of rapid intensity change. This combination allows for effective edge detection while minimizing the impact of noise.Mathematical FormulationGaussian Smoothing: The image is first smoothed using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise. The Gaussian filter is defined as: G(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2 } e^{\\frac{x^2 + y^2 }{2 \\sigma^2}}, \\sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian. Laplacian Operator: The Laplacian operator is then applied to the smoothed image. The Laplacian is defined as: \\nabla^ 2 f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}LoG: The combined LoG operator is the result of convolving the Gaussian-smoothed image with the Laplacian: LoG(x,y) = \\nabla^2 (G(x,y) * I(x,y))AdvantagesReduces noise through Gaussian smoothing before edge detection.Effective at detecting edges of various orientations and scales.DisadvantagesComputationally intensive due to the convolution operations.Sensitive to the choice of σ\\sigmaσ (standard deviation of the Gaussian).2. Difference of Gaussian (DoG)The Difference of Gaussian (DoG) is an edge detection technique that approximates the Laplacian of Gaussian by subtracting two Gaussian-blurred versions of the image with different standard deviations. This method is simpler and faster to compute than LoG while providing similar edge detection capabilities.Mathematical Formulation:Gaussian Smoothing: The image is smoothed using two Gaussian filters with different standard deviations, \\sigma_1 and \\sigma_2​: G_1 (x,y) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma_{1}^{2}} e^{\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\\sigma_{1}^{2}}}, \\quad G_2(x,y) =\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma_{2}^{2}} e^{\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\\sigma_{2}^{2}}} Difference of Gaussian: The DoG is computed by subtracting the two Gaussian-blurred images: DoG(x,y) = (G_{σ_1}(x,y)−G_{σ_2}(x,y))∗I(x,y)AdvantagesComputationally more efficient than LoG.Provides good edge detection by approximating the Laplacian of Gaussian.DisadvantagesLess accurate than LoG due to the approximation.Sensitive to the choice of the standard deviations (\\sigma_1​ and \\sigma_2) for the Gaussian filters.Canny Edge DetectorThe Canny Edge Detector is a multi-stage algorithm known for its accuracy and robustness in detecting edges. Introduced by John Canny in 1986, this method aims to find edges by looking for the local maxima of the gradient of the image. It optimizes the edge detection process based on three criteria: low error rate, good localization, and minimal response to noise.Steps Involved:Smoothing: The first step involves reducing noise in the image using a Gaussian filter: G(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2} e ^ {\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}. The image is convolved with this Gaussian kernel to produce a smoothed image.Finding Gradients: The gradients of the smoothed image are computed using finite difference approximations, typically with the Sobel operator:\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-2 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0  \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\nThe gradient magnitude is then computed as: G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}} , \\quad \\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\frac{G_y}{G_x}. Non-Maximum Suppression: This step involves thinning the edges by suppressing non-maximum gradient values. Only the local maxima in the direction of the gradient are preserved, resulting in a set of thin edges.Double Thresholding: Two thresholds, T_{\\text{low }}  \\text{and }  T_{\\text{high}} ​, are applied to classify the gradient magnitudes into strong, weak, and non-relevant pixels:Strong edges: G \\geq T_{\\text{high}}Weak edges: T_{\\text{low}} \\leq G < T_{\\text{high}}Non-relevant pixels: G < T_{\\text{low}}Edge Tracking by Hysteresis: Weak edges connected to strong edges are preserved, while others are discarded. This step ensures continuity and accuracy in edge detection by linking weak edge pixels that form a continuous line with strong edges.AdvantagesHigh accuracy and robustness to noise.Good localization of edges.Produces thin, well-defined edges.DisadvantagesComputationally intensive due to multiple processing steps.Sensitive to the choice of thresholds for double thresholding.ConclusionEdge detection is a crucial technique in computer vision and image processing, essential for identifying object boundaries and simplifying image analysis. Different algorithms offer unique advantages and trade-offs, making it important to choose the right method for specific applications.\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nImage Segmentation with Watershed Algorithm - OpenCV Python\nR\nrishu23454\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nBlogathon\nComputer Vision\nAI-ML-DS\nData Science Blogathon 2024\nSimilar Reads\nImage Processing Algorithms in Computer Vision In the field of computer vision, image preprocessing is a crucial step that involves transforming raw image data into a format that can be effectively utilized by machine learning algorithms.

Their ability to learn hierarchical representations of visual data makes them exceptionally powerful. A critical component of training CNNs is backpropagation, the algorithm used for effectively updating the network's weights. This article delves into the mathematical underpinnings of backpropagation within CNNs, explaining how it works and its crucial role in neural network training.Understanding BackpropagationBackpropagation, short for \"backward propagation of errors,\" is an algorithm used to calculate the gradient of the loss function of a neural network with respect to its weights. It is essentially a method to update the weights to minimize the loss. Backpropagation is crucial because it tells us how to change our weights to improve our network’s performance.Role of Backpropagation in CNNsIn a CNN, backpropagation plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the filters and weights during training, allowing the network to better differentiate features in the input data. CNNs typically consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Each of these layers has weights and biases that are adjusted via backpropagation.Fundamentals of BackpropagationBackpropagation, in essence, is an application of the chain rule from calculus used to compute the gradients (partial derivatives) of a loss function with respect to the weights of the network. The process involves three main steps: the forward pass, loss calculation, and the backward pass.The Forward PassDuring the forward pass, input data (e.g., an image) is passed through the network to compute the output. For a CNN, this involves several key operations:Convolutional Layers: Each convolutional layer applies numerous filters to the input. For a given layer l with filters denoted by F, input I, and bias b, the output O is given by: O = (I * F) + b  Here, * denotes the convolution operation.Activation Functions: After convolution, an activation function σ\\sigmaσ (e.g., ReLU) is applied element-wise to introduce non-linearity: O = \\sigma((I * F) + b)Pooling Layers: Pooling (e.g., max pooling) reduces dimensionality, summarizing the features extracted by the convolutional layers.Loss CalculationAfter computing the output, a loss function L is calculated to assess the error in prediction. Common loss functions include mean squared error for regression tasks or cross-entropy loss for classification:L = -\\sum y \\log(\\hat{y})Here, y is the true label, and \\hat{y}​ is the predicted label.The Backward Pass (Backpropagation)The backward pass computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network by applying the chain rule:Gradient with respect to output: First, calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of the final layer: \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O}Gradient through activation function: Apply the chain rule through the activation function: \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O} \\frac{\\partial O}{\\partial I} For ReLU, \\frac{\\partial{O}}{\\partial{I}}​ is 1 for I > 0 and 0 otherwise.Gradient with respect to filters in convolutional layers: Continue applying the chain rule to find the gradients with respect to the filters:\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial F} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial O} * rot180(I)Here, rot180(I) rotates the input by 180 degrees, aligning it for the convolution operation used to calculate the gradient with respect to the filter.Weight UpdateUsing the gradients calculated, the weights are updated using an optimization algorithm such as SGD:F_{new} = F_{old} - \\eta \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial F}Here, \\eta is the learning rate, which controls the step size during the weight update.Challenges in Backpropagation Vanishing GradientsIn deep networks, backpropagation can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become too small to make significant changes in weights, stalling the training. Advanced activation functions like ReLU and optimization techniques such as batch normalization are used to mitigate this issue.Exploding GradientsConversely, gradients can become excessively large; this is known as exploding gradients. This can be controlled by techniques such as gradient clipping.ConclusionBackpropagation in CNNs is a sophisticated yet elegantly mathematical process crucial for learning from vast amounts of visual data.

What Experts ThinkWritten by Nancy Schimelpfening, MS on May 28, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJShare on PinterestFibermaxxing emphasizes fiber intake during meals and snacks, which could aid weight loss and help lower the risk of chronic diseases. Knape/Getty Images‘Fibermaxxing’ is TikTok’s latest nutrition trend emphasizing fiber intake during meals and snacks.Nutrition experts say fibermaxxing can provide numerous health benefits, including weight loss and a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases.Older adults and those with certain health conditions should consult with their doctor before increasing fiber intake.If you don’t normally eat a lot of fiber, build up slowly to avoid gastrointestinal upset.TikTokers are bulking up — not at the gym, but in the produce aisle.The latest viral nutrition trend is “fibermaxxing,” which has influencers cramming their shopping carts with fiber-rich veggies, beans, and whole grains.Advocates say fibermaxxing offers more than just digestive perks. By nourishing gut bacteria and supporting hormone balance, maximizing your fiber intake could help regulate mood and promote weight loss.The trend is also linked to improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels, which could lower the risk of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), heart disease, and even some cancers, including colorectal cancer.But is more always better when it comes to fibrous roughage?Healthline spoke with dietitians to learn more about the benefits and potential pitfalls of fibermaxxing.What is fibermaxxing?Kara Landau, RD, of the Gut Feeling Consultancy and nutrition advisor to the Global Prebiotic Association, explained that fibermaxxing focuses on consciously adding more fiber to your meals and snacks throughout the day to ensure that you are getting enough.“Compared to many of the unsafe and not scientifically supported dietary trends that sweep across social media, fibermaxxing at its essence is actually a very positive direction for people’s eating patterns to go,” she told Healthline, “and is aligned with common dietary advice offered by many registered dietitians and health care professionals.”Landau noted that dietary fiber recommendations generally vary by age and sex.However, the range is generally from 25 to 38 grams per day, with the lower end for females and the higher end for males.These numbers go down slightly for adults over 50, she added.Dahlia Marin, RDN, LD, CGN, CEO at Married to Health, further clarified the fiber needs of older adults. She said adult males over 50 only need 30 grams per day, while adult females in this age group only need 21 grams per day.Children require anywhere from 14 to 25 grams of daily fiber, depending on age and sex, she said.Fiber may promote weight loss, lower chronic disease riskConsuming adequate dietary fiber is associated with various health benefits.For instance, fiber supports healthy digestion and feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut, Landau explained. This, in turn, can help regulate hormones, including those that influence mood and body weight.Fiber also helps manage blood sugar and cholesterol levels, making it a valuable resource for potentially reducing the risk of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.“Dietary fiber has also been seen to play a protective role against some cancers,” Landau said. Indeed, high fiber intake is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer. Additionally, a recent study suggests that higher intakes of dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates are associated with healthy aging and longevity in women.Who should avoid fibermaxxing?High fiber diets may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain health conditions.Those who are older than 50, have health conditions like short bowel syndrome, pelvic prolapse, and others may feel worse on a high fiber diet, Marin said. If you meet any of these criteria, you should consult with your doctor before increasing your fiber intake.“People with existing gut conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and more may need to temporarily reduce their fiber intake, then add more fiber to their diets slowly and strategically to prevent any adverse gut symptoms,” Marin advised.She additionally suggested that a reverse elimination diet may be beneficial in order to increase tolerance and allow time for gut healing.“Generally, this trend is a great idea to encourage increased fiber intake, therefore preventing future gut issues, however, it may not be appropriate for everyone,” Marin said.How to boost your fiber intakeMarin said you can add more dietary fiber to your diet by simply increasing the amount of plant foods you consume.“Aim to have at least one fiber-rich food with each meal and snack,” she suggested.Some of Marin’s favorite high fiber foods include: kiwichiadragon fruitwhole grainsbeans and legumescarrotsblueberriessweet potatoesoatskalebroccoliavocadosLandau added that if you’re looking at packaged foods that promote higher fiber levels, you’ll want to read the label to ensure that there is a range of ingredients that could be providing the fiber rather than one isolated fiber at the top of the ingredient list.Some examples to look out for include: soluble corn fiberchicory root inulinpolydextrose“This is recommended to both prevent digestive troubles as well as help promote the feeding of a range of probiotics in your gut that all preferentially consume and thrive off different prebiotic fiber sources,” she explained.Landau further noted that older adults who have built up a tolerance may be able to receive benefits from a higher fiber intake, provided that the fiber is coming from a variety of whole foods, including: vegetablesfruitswhole grainslegumeslentilsnutsseeds“I would recommend people do not simply look at the number of grams of fiber in any product, but rather the diversity in fibers, coming from different sources, and offering both soluble and insoluble fibers to mitigate digestive distress,” she said.If you’re just starting to increase your fiber intake, you should also increase your water consumption. This will help keep your digestive tract moving so you can pass any undesirable gas or bloating, Landau said.Experts say most people may benefit from fibermaxxingFibermaxxing may be trending on TikTok, but the science behind it holds water. Boosting your daily fiber intake may offer a wide range of health benefits, from better blood sugar management and improved digestion to hormone balance and even chronic disease prevention.Fiber also promotes satiety, which can promote weight loss and healthy weight management.Experts agree that most people could benefit from eating more plant-based, fiber-rich foods.However, jumping into a high fiber lifestyle without preparation can backfire, especially for people with sensitive guts, those taking certain medical conditions, or adults over 50.The key is to personalize your approach: increase fiber gradually, drink more water, and prioritize a variety of whole food sources. Labels can help, but diversity in fiber types — from fruits and veggies to legumes and grains — matters more than the grams alone.Before you follow the trend, listen to your gut — literally. With a bit of strategy, fibermaxxing can be a smart, sustainable upgrade to your daily routine rather than a rough ride through your digestive system.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Nancy Schimelpfening, MS on May 28, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextIs Okra Water Actually Healthy?

In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.Additional Types:Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered a subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.Module 1: Machine Learning PipelineIn order to make predictions there are some steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions. ML workflowData CleaningFeature ScalingData Preprocessing in PythonModule 2: Supervised Learning Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types: Classification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories Regression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values. Supervised Learning There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are:1. Linear RegressionThis is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output.Introduction to Linear RegressionGradient Descent in Linear RegressionMultiple Linear RegressionRidge RegressionLasso regressionElastic net Regression2. Logistic RegressionUsed when the output is a \"yes or no\" type answer.

Random Forest (Bagging Algorithm)A powerful model that builds lots of decision trees and combines them for better accuracy and stability.Introduction to Random forestRandom Forest ClassifierRandom Forest RegressionHyperparameter Tuning in Random ForestIntroduction to Ensemble LearningEnsemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning:Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently.Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one.Module 3: Unsupervised learningUnsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose: Clustering Association Rule MiningDimensionality Reduction. Unsupervised learning1. ClusteringClustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarities or differences. Types of clustering algorithms are:Centroid-based Methods:K-Means clusteringElbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeansK-Means++ clusteringK-Mode clusteringFuzzy C-Means (FCM) ClusteringDistribution-based Methods: Gaussian mixture modelsExpectation-Maximization AlgorithmDirichlet process mixture models (DPMMs)Connectivity based methods: Hierarchical clustering Agglomerative ClusteringDivisive clusteringAffinity propagationDensity Based methods: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)2.

Originating in 2018, this framework was crafted by researchers from Google AI Language. The article aims to explore the architecture, working and applications of BERT.What is BERT?BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) leverages a transformer-based neural network to understand and generate human-like language. BERT employs an encoder-only architecture. In the original Transformer architecture, there are both encoder and decoder modules. The decision to use an encoder-only architecture in BERT suggests a primary emphasis on understanding input sequences rather than generating output sequences.Bidirectional Approach of BERTTraditional language models process text sequentially, either from left to right or right to left. This method limits the model's awareness to the immediate context preceding the target word. BERT uses a bi-directional approach considering both the left and right context of words in a sentence, instead of analyzing the text sequentially, BERT looks at all the words in a sentence simultaneously.Example: \"The bank is situated on the _______ of the river.\"In a unidirectional model, the understanding of the blank would heavily depend on the preceding words, and the model might struggle to discern whether \"bank\" refers to a financial institution or the side of the river.BERT, being bidirectional, simultaneously considers both the left (\"The bank is situated on the\") and right context (\"of the river\"), enabling a more nuanced understanding. It comprehends that the missing word is likely related to the geographical location of the bank, demonstrating the contextual richness that the bidirectional approach brings.Pre-training and Fine-tuning BERT Model The BERT model undergoes a two-step process:Pre-training on Large amounts of unlabeled text to learn contextual embeddings.Fine-tuning on labeled data for specific NLP tasks.Pre-Training on Large DataBERT is pre-trained on large amount of unlabeled text data. The model learns contextual embeddings, which are the representations of words that take into account their surrounding context in a sentence.BERT engages in various unsupervised pre-training tasks. For instance, it might learn to predict missing words in a sentence (Masked Language Model or MLM task), understand the relationship between two sentences, or predict the next sentence in a pair.Fine-Tuning on Labeled DataAfter the pre-training phase, the BERT model, armed with its contextual embeddings, is then fine-tuned for specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This step tailors the model to more targeted applications by adapting its general language understanding to the nuances of the particular task.BERT is fine-tuned using labeled data specific to the downstream tasks of interest. These tasks could include sentiment analysis, question-answering, named entity recognition, or any other NLP application. The model's parameters are adjusted to optimize its performance for the particular requirements of the task at hand.BERT's unified architecture allows it to adapt to various downstream tasks with minimal modifications, making it a versatile and highly effective tool in natural language understanding and processing.How BERT work?BERT is designed to generate a language model so, only the encoder mechanism is used. Sequence of tokens are fed to the Transformer encoder. These tokens are first embedded into vectors and then processed in the neural network. The output is a sequence of vectors, each corresponding to an input token, providing contextualized representations.When training language models, defining a prediction goal is a challenge. Many models predict the next word in a sequence, which is a directional approach and may limit context learning. BERT addresses this challenge with two innovative training strategies:Masked Language Model (MLM)Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)1. Masked Language Model (MLM)In BERT's pre-training process, a portion of words in each input sequence is masked and the model is trained to predict the original values of these masked words based on the context provided by the surrounding words.In simple terms,Masking words: Before BERT learns from sentences, it hides some words (about 15%) and replaces them with a special symbol, like [MASK].Guessing Hidden Words: BERT's job is to figure out what these hidden words are by looking at the words around them. It's like a game of guessing where some words are missing, and BERT tries to fill in the blanks.How BERT learns:BERT adds a special layer on top of its learning system to make these guesses. It then checks how close its guesses are to the actual hidden words.It does this by converting its guesses into probabilities, saying, \"I think this word is X, and I'm this much sure about it.\"Special Attention to Hidden WordsBERT's main focus during training is on getting these hidden words right. It cares less about predicting the words that are not hidden.This is because the real challenge is figuring out the missing parts, and this strategy helps BERT become really good at understanding the meaning and context of words.In technical terms,BERT adds a classification layer on top of the output from the encoder. This layer is crucial for predicting the masked words.The output vectors from the classification layer are multiplied by the embedding matrix, transforming them into the vocabulary dimension. This step helps align the predicted representations with the vocabulary space.The probability of each word in the vocabulary is calculated using the SoftMax activation function. This step generates a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for each masked position.The loss function used during training considers only the prediction of the masked values. The model is penalized for the deviation between its predictions and the actual values of the masked words.The model converges slower than directional models. This is because, during training, BERT is only concerned with predicting the masked values, ignoring the prediction of the non-masked words. The increased context awareness achieved through this strategy compensates for the slower convergence.2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax.In the training process, BERT learns to understand the relationship between pairs of sentences, predicting if the second sentence follows the first in the original document.50% of the input pairs have the second sentence as the subsequent sentence in the original document, and the other 50% have a randomly chosen sentence.To help the model distinguish between connected and disconnected sentence pairs. The input is processed before entering the model:A [CLS] token is inserted at the beginning of the first sentence, and a [SEP] token is added at the end of each sentence.A sentence embedding indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token.A positional embedding indicates the position of each token in the sequence.BERT predicts if the second sentence is connected to the first. This is done by transforming the output of the [CLS] token into a 2×1 shaped vector using a classification layer, and then calculating the probability of whether the second sentence follows the first using SoftMax.During the training of BERT model, the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction are trained together. The model aims to minimize the combined loss function of the Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction, leading to a robust language model with enhanced capabilities in understanding context within sentences and relationships between sentences.Why to train Masked LM and Next Sentence Prediction together?Masked LM helps BERT to understand the context within a sentence and Next Sentence Prediction helps BERT grasp the connection or relationship between pairs of sentences. Hence, training both the strategies together ensures that BERT learns a broad and comprehensive understanding of language, capturing both details within sentences and the flow between sentences.BERT ArchitectureThe architecture of BERT is a multilayer bidirectional transformer encoder which is quite similar to the transformer model. A transformer architecture is an encoder-decoder network that uses self-attention on the encoder side and attention on the decoder side.BERTBASE has 12 layers in the Encoder stack while BERTLARGE has 24 layers in the Encoder stack. These are more than the Transformer architecture described in the original paper (6 encoder layers).BERT architectures (BASE and LARGE) also have larger feedforward networks (768 and 1024 hidden units respectively), and more attention heads (12 and 16 respectively) than the Transformer architecture suggested in the original paper. It contains 512 hidden units and 8 attention heads.BERTBASE contains 110M parameters while BERTLARGE has 340M parameters.BERT BASE and BERT LARGE architecture.This model takes the CLS token as input first, then it is followed by a sequence of words as input. Here CLS is a classification token. It then passes the input to the above layers. Each layer applies self-attention and passes the result through a feedforward network after then it hands off to the next encoder. The model outputs a vector of hidden size (768 for BERT BASE). If we want to output a classifier from this model we can take the output corresponding to the CLS token.BERT output as EmbeddingsNow, this trained vector can be used to perform a number of tasks such as classification, translation, etc. For Example, the paper achieves great results just by using a single layer Neural Network on the BERT model in the classification task. How to use BERT model in NLP?BERT can be used for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as:1. Classification TaskBERT can be used for classification task like sentiment analysis, the goal is to classify the text into different categories (positive/ negative/ neutral), BERT can be employed by adding a classification layer on the top of the Transformer output for the [CLS] token.The [CLS] token represents the aggregated information from the entire input sequence. This pooled representation can then be used as input for a classification layer to make predictions for the specific task.2. Question AnsweringIn question answering tasks, where the model is required to locate and mark the answer within a given text sequence, BERT can be trained for this purpose.BERT is trained for question answering by learning two additional vectors that mark the beginning and end of the answer. During training, the model is provided with questions and corresponding passages, and it learns to predict the start and end positions of the answer within the passage.3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)BERT can be utilized for NER, where the goal is to identify and classify entities (e.g., Person, Organization, Date) in a text sequence.A BERT-based NER model is trained by taking the output vector of each token form the Transformer and feeding it into a classification layer. The layer predicts the named entity label for each token, indicating the type of entity it represents.How to Tokenize and Encode Text using BERT?To tokenize and encode text using BERT, we will be using the 'transformer' library in Python.Command to install transformers:!pip install transformersWe will load the pretrained BERT tokenize with a cased vocabulary using BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\").tokenizer.encode(text) tokenizes the input text and converts it into a sequence of token IDs.print(\"Token IDs:\", encoding) prints the token IDs obtained after encoding.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoding) converts the token IDs back to their corresponding tokens.print(\"Tokens:\", tokens) prints the tokens obtained after converting the token IDs\nPython\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer\n# Load pre-trained BERT tokenizer\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\n# Input text\ntext = 'ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. '\n# Tokenize and encode the text\nencoding = tokenizer.encode(text)\n# Print the token IDs\nprint(\"Token IDs:\", encoding)\n# Convert token IDs back to tokens\ntokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoding)\n# Print the corresponding tokens\nprint(\"Tokens:\", tokens)\nOutput:Token IDs: [101, 24705, 1204, 17095, 1942, 1110, 170, 1846, 2235, 1872, 1118, 3353, 1592, 2240, 117, 1359, 1113, 1103, 15175, 1942, 113, 9066, 15306, 11689, 118, 3972, 13809, 23763, 114, 4220, 119, 102]Tokens: ['[CLS]', 'Cha', '##t', '##GP', '##T', 'is', 'a', 'language', 'model', 'developed', 'by', 'Open', '##A', '##I', ',', 'based', 'on', 'the', 'GP', '##T', '(', 'Gene', '##rative', 'Pre', '-', 'trained', 'Trans', '##former', ')', 'architecture', '.', '[SEP]']The tokenizer.encode method adds the special [CLS] - classification and [SEP] - separator tokens at the beginning and end of the encoded sequence. In the token IDs section, token id: 101 refers to the start of the sentence and token id: 102 represents the end of the sentence. Application of BERTBERT is used for:Text Representation: BERT is used to generate word embeddings or representation for words in a sentence.Named Entity Recognition (NER): BERT can be fine-tuned for named entity recognition tasks, where the goal is to identify entities such as names of people, organizations, locations, etc., in a given text.Text Classification: BERT is widely used for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization. It has demonstrated excellent performance in understanding and classifying the context of textual data.Question-Answering Systems: BERT has been applied to question-answering systems, where the model is trained to understand the context of a question and provide relevant answers. This is particularly useful for tasks like reading comprehension.Machine Translation: BERT's contextual embeddings can be leveraged for improving machine translation systems. The model captures the nuances of language that are crucial for accurate translation.Text Summarization: BERT can be used for abstractive text summarization, where the model generates concise and meaningful summaries of longer texts by understanding the context and semantics.Conversational AI: BERT is employed in building conversational AI systems, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and dialogue systems. Its ability to grasp context makes it effective for understanding and generating natural language responses.Semantic Similarity: BERT embeddings can be used to measure semantic similarity between sentences or documents. This is valuable in tasks like duplicate detection, paraphrase identification, and information retrieval.BERT vs GPTThe difference between BERTand GPT are as follows: BERTGPTArchitectureBERT is designed for bidirectional representation learning. It uses a masked language model objective, where it predicts missing words in a sentence based on both left and right context.GPT, on the other hand, is designed for generative language modeling. It predicts the next word in a sentence given the preceding context, utilizing a unidirectional autoregressive approach.Pre-training ObjectivesBERT is pre-trained using a masked language model objective and next sentence prediction. It focuses on capturing bidirectional context and understanding relationships between words in a sentence.GPT is pre-trained to predict the next word in a sentence, which encourages the model to learn a coherent representation of language and generate contextually relevant sequences.Context UnderstandingBERT is effective for tasks that require a deep understanding of context and relationships within a sentence, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question-answering.GPT is strong in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. It is often used in creative tasks, dialogue systems, and tasks requiring the generation of natural language sequences.Task types and Use Cases Commonly used in tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and question-answering.Applied to tasks such as text generation, dialogue systems, summarization, and creative writing.Fine-tuning vs Few-Shot LearningBERT is often fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks with labeled data to adapt its pre-trained representations to the task at hand.GPT is designed to perform few-shot learning, where it can generalize to new tasks with minimal task-specific training data.Also Check:Sentiment Classification Using BERTHow to Generate Word Embedding using BERT?BART Model for Text Auto Completion in NLPToxic Comment Classification using BERTNext Sentence Prediction using BERT\nComment\nMore infoAdvertise with us\nNext Article\nGenerative AI Applications\nP\npawangfg\nFollow\nImprove\nArticle Tags :\nNLP\nNatural-language-processing\nSimilar Reads\nArtificial Intelligence Tutorial | AI Tutorial  Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines which helps in allowing them to think and act like humans.

Financial experts weigh in on the best ways to recover from a period of overspending. \"Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn't represent the pace of your entire life,\" says financial advisor Lazetta Rainey Braxton.Jose Luis Pelaez Inc | DigitalVision | Getty ImagesIt's officially \"Maycember,\" a term making the rounds on social media to sum up the chaos and high costs of May — which mimic those of December, minus the holiday cheer.Although May is typically a month of endings and new beginnings, inflation and social pressure have helped drive up the prices for many of the expenses that fall within its 31 days.From graduation gifts and prom attire to camp payments, dance recitals and sports tournaments, the gauntlet of events has left parents feeling particularly strained.Why 'Maycember' is 'a storm of financial stress'\"May often feels like a second December because so many expenses pile up at once,\" said Isabel Barrow, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"Graduations, school events, weddings and summer travel plans all converge, creating a storm of financial stress.\"More from FA Playbook:Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.3 key money moves to consider while the Fed keeps interest rates higherThe average 401(k) savings rate hit a record high. See if you're on trackAmericans believe real estate, gold are the best long-term investmentsThe key is not to panic, Barrow said. \"It's important to remember that a long-term plan requires long-term perspective, and one month of overspending doesn't have to derail your financial goals.\"How to bounce back in JuneMost financial experts recommend going back to a basic budget. \"The first step towards recovery is to take the time to review your spending and reassess your financial plan,\" Barrow said. \"Financial well-being begins with awareness and the feeling that you are regaining control.\"If you've racked up credit card debt, start addressing that immediately, Barrow said. To stay motivated, try picking a repayment strategy, such as the avalanche method or the snowball method, which respectively prioritize paying off the highest-interest debt first or paying off your debt from smallest to largest balance.At the same time, automating your savings is one of the best ways to rebuild after a heavy spending period, Barrow said: \"Set up a recurring transfer to your emergency fund or savings account.\" If your employer offers direct deposit splitting, use that to route a portion of your paycheck directly into savings, she advised.watch nowVIDEO2:3702:37Parents want schools to step up in teaching kids financial literacyPower LunchThe start of summer is also a good time to scale back, according to certified financial planner Lazetta Rainey Braxton, founder and managing principal of the Real Wealth Coterie. Pack a picnic lunch for a day at the park, or \"find free events such as museum days and public events.\"There may also be more opportunities to pick up a side gig this time of year, she added, such as babysitting or tutoring over the long break from school. Those funds can help turbocharge debt repayment. Plan ahead for next 'Maycember'\"Know that Maycember is a stretch month that doesn't represent the pace of your entire life,\" said Braxton, who is a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. \"Use your experience as a guide with a rearview mirror.\"Tally what you've spent on activities and celebrations such as Mother's Day, graduations and vacations, as well as any payments towards camps or summer activities. Use that total to make a plan for next year, she advised.\"Start a Maycember fund by creating a separate savings account and setting aside $25 a month or more,\" she said. That advance planning can also come in handy to make the most of sales holidays later in the year, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, she added.Still, \"It's important to remember that you don't need to overspend or go beyond your budget to give meaningful gifts,\" cautioned Kelli Smith, a director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. \"Thoughtfulness and creativity can make a big impact.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.More In FA PlaybookMost Americans say this financial milestone makes you an adultJessica DicklerAverage 401(k) savings rates are at record-high levels.

There’s a good chance that you’ve eaten palm oil or used products made with it. It’s used for cooking and as an ingredient in foods like crackers, butter substitutes, and frozen foods, as well as products like soap, shampoo, makeup, and even biofuel (1).However, the methods used to produce palm oil are highly unsustainable and wreak havoc on the environment of Southeast Asia.Nevertheless, the palm oil industry claims that this crop plays a significant role in the food system and provides jobs in the countries where it’s grown.As a dietitian concerned with the future of our global food system, I want to take an in-depth look at palm oil’s environmental impact, as it’s clear that our current use of palm oil isn’t sustainable long term.This article reviews some pressing sustainability issues with palm oil and explores a few ways that you can advocate for better production practices. Share on PinterestGlowimages/Getty ImagesWhy palm oil is so popularMany of us don’t realize just how common palm oil is. In 2021, the world produced more than 167 million pounds (75.7 million kg) of it (2).Palm is already the most used vegetable oil in the world, and demand for it is only expected to grow (3).This oil rose in popularity during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries and again over the past few decades as manufacturers began looking for versatile ingredients to replace trans fats in processed foods.Palm oil not only acts as a preservative but also remains stable under high temperatures and has a mild flavor and smooth texture. Plus, growing and harvesting it is cost-effective. As the food industry realized palm oil’s perks, its use increased greatly during the 1970s and 1980s. This oil is now used in as many as half of all consumer goods (4).SUMMARYPalm oil’s use has grown exponentially over the past few decades. It’s hidden in many more products and foods than we tend to realize due to its versatile uses and effectiveness as a high volume crop.The environmental cost of palm oilJust a few counties — mainly Indonesia and Malaysia — produce nearly 85% of the planet’s palm oil (2). Parts of Southeastern Asia, Africa, and Latin America where palm oil is grown are most affected by its production. Even so, because its impacts on the environment are so significant, the final toll of palm oil production may be much further reaching (5).Here are some of the most notable environmental concerns involving palm oil:Deforestation. In some parts of Asia, palm oil is estimated to cause nearly half of all deforestation. Clear-cutting forests for agriculture releases greenhouse gases, leads to the destruction of habits, and threatens biodiversity (5, 6, 7, 8).Pollution. The large-scale production of an agricultural commodity like palm oil inevitably leads to runoff and pollution of nearby soil and waterways. Deforestation to make way for palm oil crops is also a major source of air pollution (4, 9, 10).Loss of biodiversity. As a result of deforestation and habitat loss, many bird, elephant, orangutan, and tiger populations are becoming increasingly threatened or endangered in countries that produce palm oil (8, 11, 12, 13).Contributes to global warming. Clear-cutting forests to establish palm oil plantations contributes to global warming by releasing excessive amounts of greenhouse gases into the air (6, 8).Unmitigated growth and production. Palm oil demand is projected to keep rising over the next 10 years. Production could grow by 100% or more in some areas, only worsening its environmental toll (5, 7).Paradoxically, palm oil production is threatened by global warming, too. Not only do some palm varieties grow poorly in warmer temperatures, but flooding from rising sea levels also threatens palm-oil-producing countries like Indonesia (14).SUMMARYThe palm oil industry is responsible for huge amounts of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution. As the industry continues to grow, these issues may only intensify.How palm oil is regulatedPalm oil production is lightly regulated — and sometimes not regulated at all. This situation gives rise to tensions between corporate interests and consumers or environmental groups demanding changes to how palm oil is made.Regulating palm oil may lead to higher prices for consumer goods, lower wages, and a loss of work for people who grow palm oil. Yet, excessive carbon emissions, such as those released by deforestation, are a threat to society as we know it (9, 15, 16, 17).These are just a few issues to consider when it comes to regulating palm oil.Researchers have proposed reducing the industry’s emissions by only using land that has already been forested for palm plantations, protecting the most carbon-rich lands like peat forests, and better managing carbon-sensitive areas (18, 19, 20, 21).A few key playersIn the private sector, organizations like the European Palm Oil Alliance (EPOA) are making commitments against deforestation, land exploitation, and peat forest development. Grocery stores like Iceland Foods have reformulated store-brand items to remove palm oil (7).In some instances, governments have stepped in. The 2015 Amsterdam Declaration aimed to phase out all palm oil that isn’t certified sustainable by 2020. The partnership now includes nine countries, including France and the United Kingdom, and has expanded its commitment to eliminating agricultural deforestation (22).Despite these efforts, enforcement is challenging due to corporate influence and a lack of resources.For example, efforts like the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) were less successful. Advertised as a commitment to stop deforestation and the development of peat forests, the IPOP was signed by Indonesia’s largest palm oil exporters in 2014 (23). The initiative fell apart just a few years later due to a lack of organization and external pressure from the industry. Some activists criticized the effort as little more than a political advertising stunt that only increased red tape around sustainability efforts.SUMMARYCurrently, no one regulatory body oversees global palm oil production. Some nations have committed to using only sustainable palm oil, while private groups are advocating for a halt to deforestation and the development of carbon-rich lands.Should you avoid palm oil?It’s a personal choice whether you decide to avoid palm oil or try to only use palm oils that have been sustainably and ethically sourced.Many of the controversies surrounding palm oil involve:the environmentclimate changesustainable agricultureIndigenous people’s right to manage their landhuman rightsworkers’ rightchild labor lawsIt’s clear that palm oil production in its current form isn’t sustainable long term.Furthermore, organizations like Amnesty International, the International Labor Rights Forum, and Human Rights Watch have accused the palm oil industry of using child labor, failing to protect the lands of Indigenous people, and other human rights abuses.Still, simply replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils may not be a viable option (5).That’s because other vegetable oil crops would likely use even more resources — and thus contribute more to climate change — than palm oil does, as palm crops grow efficiently and have a significantly higher output than other oil-producing plants.What if it’s grown responsibly?If palm oil were produced ethically and sustainably, it could offer numerous benefits. Aside from being an effective cooking oil, it works well as a soap and fuel. Plus, people have been cooking with palm oil in Africa for thousands of years (1, 24). Palm oil also has nutritional benefits because it contains healthy fats, numerous antioxidants, and vitamins A and E. Unrefined palm oil, also called red palm oil, may contain the most amount of nutrients since it’s cold pressed rather than heated during processing (25, 26, 27, 28).Nevertheless, research on palm oil’s nutrients is conflicting. It may be healthiest when used in place of other less healthy fats like trans fats (29, 30, 31, 32).SUMMARYPalm oil is rich in healthy fats, some vitamins, and antioxidants. Though it can be part of a healthy diet, some people choose to limit it or use only sustainably grown palm oil due to the industry’s environmental and human rights abuses.How to spot palm oil — and advocate for changeYou can advocate against the harmful effects of palm oil in the following ways.1. Familiarize yourself with the names of palm oilKnowing how to spot palm oil on an ingredient list is essential to understanding how common it is and learning where it might be hiding in your own diet, hygiene, or wellness routine.It’s also key if you’ve decided to cut back your use of palm oil.Some of the most common ingredients derived from palm oil are:palmatepalmitatesodium laureth sulfate (sometimes contains palm oil)sodium lauryl sulfate (sometimes contains palm oil)glyceryl stearatestearic acidvegetable oil (sometimes contains palm oil)2. Know your certificationsPurchasing palm oil that has been certified sustainable by an accrediting body lets industry leaders know that consumers are concerned about these issues.Some certifications may be designated by an icon on product labels. A few of the most common include:The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Palm oil producers must verify that their production processes meet the sustainability criteria set out by the RSPO.International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). Certified organizations must commit to halting deforestation, protecting soil and water, and safeguarding human and workers’ rights.The Rainforest Alliance. Farms must meet standards in various areas of social, economic, and environmental sustainability.Malaysia and Indonesia each have government-led certification programs. The Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Certification. The national certification of Malaysia reviews palm oil processing plants for certain management and supply chain standards.The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) Certification. This effort by the Indonesian government certifies sustainable growers in the country.Still, environmental advocates have questioned the credibility of such programs due to the influence of the palm oil industry (33).3. Request transparency from the palm oil industryDon’t be afraid to reach out directly to palm oil producers, distributors, and companies that use palm oil in their products. Ask key players in the industry about their practices and encourage them to move toward sustainable palm oil.By signing online petitions, sending emails, or joining protests, you can encourage companies that rely on palm oil to adopt sustainability principles.4. Keep up the pressurePolicies to promote sustainable palm oilGovernment policy can be wielded to stop deforestation and promote sustainable palm oil. Specific policies that would lessen palm oil’s environmental impact include:Bans on deforestation. Creating national parks, limiting clearcutting practices, and banning deforestation in fragile areas would protect rainforests and critical ecosystems.Stricter trade criteria. Countries could decide to only import palm oil and palm oil products grown in a sustainable manner.Land use regulation. Governments could mandate that palm plantations only be developed on land that has already been forested for several years. Sustainability promises and certifications are a step in the right direction, but the palm oil industry needs a systematic overhaul to remain viable into the future. Standing up to a major industry like the palm oil lobby might feel like a daunting task, but you won’t be alone. When ordinary citizens band together for a cause they’re passionate about, they can achieve extraordinary things. Some ways to campaign for change around palm oil include:Signing petitions. Environmental groups like Greenpeace organize online petitions to stop the harmful impacts of palm oil. Joining protests. You may be able to find a community group that helps raise awareness of palm oil’s effects. Other ways to advocate include avoiding palm oil or lobbying elected officials on its issues. Spreading the word. Many people are still unaware of the harmful effects palm oil has on communities and the environment. You can be an advocate for change by helping educate others on palm oil. SUMMARYYou can advocate for sustainable palm oil by limiting how much you use it, buying products that are certified sustainable, requesting transparency from the palm oil industry, and putting pressure on its main players to find sustainable alternatives. The bottom linePalm oil is abundant in the food system and common household products.However, its environmental impact is profound. Although certain concrete steps, such as halting deforestation and growing palm only on previously forested lands, could reduce palm oil’s environmental impacts, the palm oil industry has so far resisted these changes.Thus, if you’re worried about the impact palm oil is having on the world around you, you can take action by limiting your palm oil usage and purchasing products that are certified as sustainable.Just one thingTry this today: Scan the foods in your pantry, the soaps on your shelves, and the cosmetics in your bag to locate hidden sources of palm oil in your home. Don’t forget to look for ingredients like palmate, glyceryl, stearate, and sodium lauryl sulfate. How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleMedically reviewed by Kim Rose-Francis RDN, CDCES, LD — Written by Cecilia Snyder, MS, RD  on June 4, 2021Read this nextPalm Oil: Does It Have Health Benefit?Written by Franziska SpritzlerPalm oil is a popular oil found in many foods.

The more experienced ≈öwiƒÖtek did not lose a single game en route to a straight sets victory over a rattled Anisimova, who struggled in her first grand slam final.\n‚Ä¢ Historic performance: ≈öwiƒÖtek is the first Polish Wimbledon singles champion ‚Äî men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs ‚Äî in the Open Era. It‚Äôs also the first time in that era that a women‚Äôs player has won the title without giving up a game.\n‚Ä¢ Emotional remarks: A jubilant ≈öwiƒÖtek, who had struggled on grass courts prior to this tournament, said after the match that she could hardly process the victory. Anisimova, who has been open about mental health struggles and took a break from the sport in 2023, lauded her opponent and thanked her support system in tearful on-court remarks.\nAll\nCatch Up\n46 Posts\nWe‚Äôve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. Read more about the match here.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek dominates on difficult day for American Amanda Anisimova\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates after winning her first Wimbledon title.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nAfter two weeks of exceptional tennis from both Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek and Amanda Anisimova, today‚Äôs women‚Äôs singles final was over before it even really began.\nIt took just 57 minutes for ≈öwiƒÖtek to dispatch her American opponent. The world No. 4 did not drop a single game on her way to lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish.\nAnisimova ‚Äî who has one of the best returns on the WTA Tour ‚Äî had no reply for the Polish star‚Äôs dominance when serving. The American forced deuce once in the second set but failed to muster a single break point throughout.\nBut it was on her own serve that the 23-year-old really lost the match. She won just 26% of her first-serve points and double-faulted five times. Alongside that, she committed 28 unforced errors.\nAt times, it was a difficult watch at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. It was easy to tell which player had experience in grand slam finals. ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs poise contrasted starkly with Anisimova‚Äôs increasing frustration.\nAmanda Anisimova appears dejected during the second set Saturday.\nHannah Peters/Getty Images\nDuring the second set, the American had opportunities to win her first game but ended up letting out a scream when that chance eluded her again.\nFor its part, the crowd at Centre Court got behind the struggling world No. 12, both during the match and afterward when she gave an emotional on-court interview.\nAnisimova‚Äôs fellow American tennis star Coco Gauff was also quick to offer her support, writing in a post on X: ‚Äúkeep your head up.‚Äù\nso much to be proud of Amanda‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è keep your head up üëë— Coco Gauff (@CocoGauff) July 12, 2025\nBut it was ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs day. The 24-year-old displayed her impressive forehand once again to round out a tournament in which she has far outperformed her previous self ‚Äî she had only made it as far as the quarterfinals before this year.\nThe world No. 4 hit three aces, won 72% of her first-serve points and converted 67% of her break points. But, in truth, it was her ability to stay in rallies and wait for Anisimova‚Äôs errors that proved most decisive.\n≈öwiƒÖtek now has a Wimbledon title to add to her 2022 US Open win, and the four she has claimed at Roland Garros. The feat sees her become the eighth woman in the Open Era to win grand slam singles titles on all three surfaces, according to Opta.\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates a point.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nLink Copied!\nIn pictures: ≈öwiƒÖtek makes Wimbledon history\nFrom CNN's Digital Photo Desk\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates after winning her first Wimbledon title.\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek overwhelmed Amanda Anisimova on Saturday to win her first Wimbledon title and her sixth grand slam overall.\nThe 6-0, 6-0 scoreline hasn‚Äôt happened in a women‚Äôs Wimbledon singles final since 1911. It‚Äôs also the second time it‚Äôs ever happened in any grand slam since Steffi Graf did it in 1988.\n≈öwiƒÖtek is the first Polish player ‚Äî man or woman ‚Äî to ever win the Wimbledon singles title. She broke Anisimova‚Äôs serve in the very first game and never looked back.\nIt was the first grand slam final for Anisimova, and it will be one the American wants to forget. Her frustration was evident throughout the match. But her talent is clear from the two weeks she‚Äôs spent at the tournament, and it likely won‚Äôt be the last we see of her.\nSee more photos from Saturday‚Äôs final:\nAmanda Anisimova reacts after a point.\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\n≈öwiƒÖtek was in superb form Saturday.

No matter what happened today, you should be proud of the work you‚Äôre doing, and I hope we‚Äôre gonna play in many more finals here and other tournaments ‚Äî you have the game for that, so congrats to your team as well.\n‚ÄúHonestly, I didn‚Äôt even dream because, for me, it was just way too far.\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek, 2025 Wimbledon women's singles champion\n‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm already an experienced player after winning the slams before, but I never really expected this one, so I want to thank my team because I feel like they believed in me more than I did.‚Äù\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs victory was historic ‚Äî and not just for Wimbledon\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates with the Venus Rosewater Dish.\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\nToday marks not only the first time in the Open Era ‚Äî and first time since 1911 ‚Äî that a player has won a women‚Äôs singles final at the All England Lawn Tennis Club without dropping a game.\nIt is also just the second time ever in the modern era, which began in 1968, that a grand slam singles final has been won in such a manner, after Steffi Graf beat Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 at Roland Garros in 1988, according to Opta.\nThe consolation for Anisimova is that Zvereva would go on to finish her career having been the world No. 1 and winning four singles titles and 20 grand slam doubles and mixed doubles titles.\nToday is ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs day, but we‚Äôll be hearing from Anisimova again.\nLink Copied!\n\"Thank you, Iga,\" Anisimova shows humor in defeat\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova speaks to the crowd after the match.\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\nA tearful Anisimova steps up for her post-match interview with the crowd cheering her on.\nAfter taking some time to compose herself, the American jokingly thanked her opponent for the thrashing on Centre Court today.\n‚ÄúThank you, Iga,‚Äù she said, before praising the Polish star.\nThe 23-year-old also said she would never forget her Wimbledon experience this year, adding she simply ‚Äúran out of gas.‚Äù\n‚ÄúI wish that I could put on a better performance for all of you. You guys have still been there for me and lifted me up today, so thank you so much,‚Äù she said.\nAnisimova then thanked her mom and burst into tears when her mom‚Äôs face appeared on the big screens inside the court.\n‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be standing here if you guys didn‚Äôt fly in and support me throughout the rest of the tournament,‚Äù she said to her friends and family.\n‚ÄúYou guys were my extra motivation and inspiration that I needed. My mom, who flew in this morning, I definitely would not be standing here.‚Äù\nA very emotional end to what has been a brilliant tournament for the American.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova walked off court briefly but is back for presentation\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova reacts after her loss.\nToby Melville/Reuters\nWhile ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrated the win, Anisimova walked off the court, maybe just to collect her thoughts.\nIt‚Äôs commonplace for the runner-up to give a post-match interview on court, but you could forgive organizers for breaking that tradition today.\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek drops to the floor in celebration\nFrom CNN's Ben Church\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek falls to the ground after winning the title.\nHannah Peters/Getty Images\nConsidering how poorly Anisimova performed in that match, it‚Äôs easy to forget how well Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek played.\nThe Polish star has created history for herself and you can see how much it meant to her after that match point whistled past the American.\nThe 24-year-old fell to her back on the grass, before she picked herself up and gave her opponent a massive hug.\nThe new Wimbledon champion then ran through the crowd to her player‚Äôs box where she celebrated with her team.\nReal emotion from a true champion.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek wins her first Wimbledon singles title in historic fashion\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek celebrates after winning match point.\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek has been crowned the women‚Äôs singles champion at Wimbledon for the first time with an unprecedented 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova.\nIt is the first time in the Open Era that a women‚Äôs player has won the final without giving up a game, and the first time overall since 1911.\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek moves closer to maiden Wimbledon title\nFrom CNN's Thomas Schlachter\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek is nearing her sixth grand slam title.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nBlink and you‚Äôll miss it.\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek is now just one game away from winning her first grand slam at Wimbledon.\nThe Polish sensation has bulldozed her way to a 5-0 lead in the second set and is making light work of her first final in SW19.\nAnisimova will be hoping to at least get one game on the board before this final ends.\nLink Copied!\nNoise is deafening every time Anisimova wins a point\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nThis has become less about who wins Wimbledon, and more can the American win a game.\nIt doesn‚Äôt look great for her at the moment, though.\nThe crowd really is pushing her on and going crazy whenever she wins a point and gets the better of a rally.\nProblem is, those moments are very few and far between.\nLink Copied!\n≈öwiƒÖtek up 4-0 again after Anisimova forces deuce\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nAmanda Anisimova reacts after a point.\nHannah Peters/Getty Images\nWe see the best showing so far from the American who forces deuce before losing a long rally.\n≈öwiƒÖtek double faults to take it back to deuce, but aces and then has too much again for her opponent on the following point.\nIt‚Äôs nothing more than small consolation for Anisimova.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova's serve letting her down\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova serves to Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek during Saturday's final.\nHenry Nicholls/AFP/Getty Images\nIt‚Äôs going from bad to worse for Anisimova in this match and it‚Äôs her serve letting her down the most.\nThe American has managed to get just 41% of her first serves in, producing four double faults in the process.\nIt‚Äôs form that simply isn‚Äôt good enough for any tennis match at this level, nevermind the Wimbledon final and you can see she knows it.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova looks dejected as ≈öwiƒÖtek breaks yet again\nFrom CNN's Thomas Schlachter\nIt has been a nightmare final so far for Amanda Anisimova.\nToby Melville/Reuters\nThis would not have been how Amanda Anisimova envisaged her first grand slam final going.\nThe American is still yet to win a single game in the matchup and now faces a 3-0 deficit and an uphill climb in the second set.\nThe crowd is starting to will the 23-year-old towards her first game of the match, but their efforts are in vain as things stand.\nWhile Anisimova has struggled with her serve, ≈öwiƒÖtek has been at her very best to punish her opponent and is dominating with her strong return game.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek is having fun out there\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek has been in top form so far in the Wimbledon final.\nToby Melville/Reuters\nIt‚Äôs hard not to feel sorry for Anisimova given how this match is going, but her opponent is looking so assured right now.\n≈öwiƒÖtek has historically struggled on grass, but is dominating here ‚Äì her serve reaches 117 mph on the way to another hold. She‚Äôs made to work for this one a bit more, with Anisimova tying the score at 30-30 before the Pole takes control again.\nLink Copied!\nScreams of frustration from Anisimova\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova is still looking to win her first game.\nStephanie Lecocq/Reuters\nThis is actually getting quite hard to watch now.\nAnisimova had chances to win her first service game there but produced two unforced errors when it really mattered.\nShe let out two screams during that game, the loudest when her opponent took yet another break point opportunity to take the lead again in this second set.\nLink Copied!\nMore of the same as Anisimova‚Äôs struggles continue\nFrom CNN's Thomas Schlachter\nAmanda Anisimova stretches for a forehand shot.\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\nAfter losing the opening set 6-0, Anisimova would have been hoping to get on the board as early as possible in the second.\nIt wasn‚Äôt to be, however, for the American who dropped yet another service game.\n≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs dominance when attacking Anisimova‚Äôs second serve is proving vital as she gets yet another break to fall her way.\nThis could be over very quickly.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs \"bakery\" open for business, even in the Wimbledon final\nFrom CNN's George Ramsay\nIt was a dominant opening set from ≈öwiƒÖtek, but this is nothing new for the Polish star.\nShe is unmatched in her ability to sweep aside opponents in brutal fashion, and her habit of winning sets 6-0 ‚Äî referred to as a ‚Äúbagel‚Äù ‚Äî and 6-1 ‚Äî a ‚Äúbreadstick‚Äù ‚Äî has led to jokes from tennis fans about ≈öwiƒÖtek running a bakery.\nAnisimova will be hoping ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs bakery closes early today.\nLink Copied!\nAnisimova looks deflated after first set thrashing\nFrom CNN's Ben Church at Wimbledon\nAmanda Anisimova has yet to find her footing in her first grand slam final.\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\nYou‚Äôve really got to feel for Anisimova here.\nShe hasn‚Äôt even completed 30 minutes of her first grand slam final and she‚Äôs already one set down.\nThe American walks over to her chair and wraps an ice towel around her neck, while rubbing an ice pack on her face.\nShe‚Äôs certainly feeling the heat in more ways than one here.\nLink Copied!\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek takes the first set in double quick time\nFrom CNN's Jamie Barton\nIga ≈öwiƒÖtek serves to Amanda Anisimova.\nKin Cheung/AP\nWe‚Äôve barely even gotten going on Centre Court, and already ≈öwiƒÖtek has claimed the first set.\nAnisimova is having to endure a nightmare start, and this game is no better. She fails to return ≈öwiƒÖtek‚Äôs first two serves, before losing the next point after an excellent rally. ≈öwiƒÖtek then seals the deal to take the game to 0.\nIf Anisimova is going to get anything from this, she‚Äôs going to have to come out for the second set playing completely differently.\nLink Copied!\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nAd Feedback\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics you follow\nSign out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nLive TV\nListen\nWatch\nWorld\nAfrica\nAmericas\nAsia\nAustralia\nChina\nEurope\nIndia\nMiddle East\nUnited Kingdom\nUS Politics\nTrump\nFacts First\nCNN Polls\n2025 Elections\nBusiness\nTech\nMedia\nCalculators\nVideos\nMarkets\nPre-markets\nAfter-Hours\nFear & Greed\nInvesting\nMarkets Now\nNightcap\nHealth\nLife, But Better\nFitness\nFood\nSleep\nMindfulness\nRelationships\nEntertainment\nMovies\nTelevision\nCelebrity\nTech\nInnovate\nForeseeable Future\nMission: Ahead\nWork Transformed\nInnovative Cities\nStyle\nArts\nDesign\nFashion\nArchitecture\nLuxury\nBeauty\nVideo\nTravel\nDestinations\nFood & Drink\nStay\nNews\nVideos\nSports\nFootball\nTennis\nGolf\nMotorsport\nUS Sports\nOlympics\nClimbing\nEsports\nHockey\nScience\nSpace\nLife\nUnearthed\nClimate\nSolutions\nWeather\nWeather\nVideo\nClimate\nUkraine-Russia War\nIsrael-Hamas War\nFeatures\nAs Equals\nCall to Earth\nFreedom Project\nImpact Your World\nInside Africa\nCNN Heroes\nWatch\nLive TV\nCNN Fast\nShows A-Z\nCNN10\nCNN Max\nCNN TV Schedules\nListen\nCNN 5 Things\nChasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\nThe Assignment with Audie Cornish\nOne Thing\nTug of War\nCNN Political Briefing\nThe Axe Files\nAll There Is with Anderson Cooper\nAll CNN Audio podcasts\nGames\nDaily Crossword\nJumble Crossword\nSudoblock\nSudoku\n5 Things Quiz\nAbout CNN\nPhotos\nInvestigations\nCNN Profiles\nCNN Leadership\nCNN Newsletters\nWork for CNN\nSports\nWatch\nListen\nLive TV\nFollow CNN\nSubscribe\nSign in\nMy Account\nSettings\nNewsletters\nTopics you follow\nSign out\nYour CNN account\nSign in to your CNN account\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nAccessibility & CC\nAbout\nNewsletters\nTranscripts\n© 2025 Cable News Network.
